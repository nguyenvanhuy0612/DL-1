__label__2 Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"
__label__2 One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.
__label__1 Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
__label__2 works fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.
__label__2 Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.
__label__1 DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.
__label__1 Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
__label__1 DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.
__label__2 Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. "Dr Shen Fu", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.
__label__1 Not an "ultimate guide": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
__label__2 Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there.
__label__1 Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.
__label__1 A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my "operating system limitations". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
__label__2 TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
__label__1 didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.
__label__1 Don't buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!
__label__2 Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
__label__2 Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.
__label__2 SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas, lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES, DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !
__label__2 Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
__label__1 Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book
__label__1 Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
__label__2 one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
__label__2 Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation.
__label__1 Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.
__label__1 Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done.
__label__2 works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40' going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know.
__label__1 Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
__label__2 wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc.
__label__1 Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
__label__2 This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
__label__2 Mary Ash: Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
__label__2 Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!
__label__2 This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
__label__2 They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD, which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity. This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well.
__label__1 Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
__label__2 Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
__label__1 Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.
__label__2 Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.
__label__1 Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.
__label__2 WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that "hunt the tomorrow" of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see...
__label__1 Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund.
__label__2 Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.
__label__2 Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix), plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would, but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone.
__label__2 Amazing...: love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
__label__2 Leslie in a nutshell: Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal, is an amazing little pedal!I use it with guitar, and keyboards.Using with Keyboards, organ mode(doesn't matter which type) jazz, rock, gives me an instant controllable Leslie effects.it includes fast and slow ramp up,boost, volume/drive. thru a mixer in stereo you can do some amazing stuff with this inexpensive unit.The only drawback i have found is the buttons are very hard to engage and disengage.But i'm working on that. i will modify the springs if possible and maybe even send a recommendation to Danelectro.
__label__1 More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the "dark" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!
__label__1 A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame.
__label__1 Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
__label__2 Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.
__label__2 Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always "one against the world", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
__label__2 Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exeptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great.
__label__1 12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell, I have heard many more clever jokes and "one-liners" watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS, it's THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly, Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective, this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!
__label__1 I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude "jokes". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.
__label__2 Wonderful, baffling mix: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird
__label__2 No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
__label__1 Disappointment at it's extreme: I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author.
__label__2 From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
__label__2 An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the "evil" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give "gifts" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell's books, especially if they are at all like this novel.
__label__2 great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie, where is it?: the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?
__label__2 Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
__label__1 Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.
__label__2 Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The "sale" prices are right for a high About end racquet, racquets and Black Knight in Have a reputation for overall durability so you Should get plenty of use Before replacement. Note: I got my first C2C as a D level player and did not like it Immediately. Howeve, as my game improved version I switched from my Bandit Black Knight C2C White racquet to the great success and Have HAD. So, It Might not be the right racquet for a beginner, intermediate to advanced players But Will Benefit From this fine racquet.
__label__1 A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
__label__1 Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational.
__label__2 sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky, secluded,isolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago, millions and millions of people, and she sings stark loneliness
__label__2 Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
__label__1 Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
__label__1 Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then: I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.
__label__2 The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
__label__2 Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.
__label__2 I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.
__label__1 WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.
__label__1 CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!
__label__1 Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
__label__1 nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
__label__2 Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.
__label__1 conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works.
__label__1 Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left.
__label__1 1, and thats being generous....: I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read"To Tess, who thinks it's about time"Author, I think she may mean something else....
__label__2 Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
__label__2 I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
__label__2 A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other "Woman against the odds" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's "Shelters of Stone".
__label__1 where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
__label__1 Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:"Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong."There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it.
__label__1 ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
__label__2 The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
__label__1 This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, "The Custom-House." Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition.
__label__2 Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
__label__1 A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point.
__label__1 Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call "classics". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?
__label__2 Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.
__label__1 Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
__label__1 Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.
__label__2 The "Scarlet" Letter: Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.
__label__2 The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.
__label__1 The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!
__label__2 This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter, I disagree. It's no wonder that people that don't know how to capitalize the word 'I'. I thought that this book was wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
__label__1 I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
__label__2 Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off.
__label__1 same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin
__label__2 Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell
__label__1 Unreadable!: As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
__label__1 Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment.
__label__1 Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
__label__1 one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.
__label__2 Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.
__label__1 very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.
__label__1 Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.
__label__1 Not the worst, but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book "The 50 worst films of all time". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!
__label__1 Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. "Love Changes Everything" is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French "Chanson d'Enfance."I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money.
__label__2 It Rises above the "Fluff" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on "emotional states" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic.
__label__2 Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced her name and address.
__label__2 great IMO: First of all, I saw the review by "Tyley Mike "Relite"" and thought he was grossly overcritical of EVERYTHING and every instrument played... so I'd like to hear Tyley Mike's album, since he thinks he can do better :) --seriously! I think some people don't understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can't write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn't evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and "grow".There's too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don't think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I'll just give it my 5 stars :)
__label__2 I wish...: ...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
__label__2 Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one.
__label__1 WOW!: This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.
__label__2 80s Hard Rock: One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
__label__1 Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80's died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.
__label__2 Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever.
__label__2 Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
__label__2 Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
__label__2 There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.
__label__2 I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! "They don't know entertainment" as Krusty would say: I do love "Charlie Brown's Christmas", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because "Charlie Brown's Christmas" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!
__label__2 Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
__label__2 Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - "Sparky" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
__label__2 great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
__label__2 Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
__label__2 The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.
__label__2 Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself, with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!
__label__1 Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?
__label__1 After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality.
__label__2 Works great, and half the price: This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch).
__label__2 This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
__label__2 Quite Satisfactory: This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.
__label__2 Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it.
__label__1 Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
__label__1 Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the "brick" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.
__label__2 So much better than the apple version!: I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!
__label__2 Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply.
__label__1 If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14"). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
__label__1 Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.
__label__1 Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.
__label__2 Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding.
__label__2 TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente, todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!
__label__2 Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of "playing with future" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull
__label__1 book only, no jacks: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
__label__2 Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
__label__1 Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though "O please get over yourself". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time.
__label__1 Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.
__label__1 Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.
__label__1 Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing.
__label__2 Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short.
__label__2 My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep, I will say read I Spy in bed.
__label__2 Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others.
__label__1 I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
__label__2 Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start.
__label__2 Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white, and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don't wear them with sandals, they aren't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker, but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers, the white and colored part are thin, stretchy and breathable, flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose.
__label__2 A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea "Individual Rights" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that "we have it in our power to make the world over again", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing "We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!
__label__2 I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
__label__2 Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
__label__2 Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
__label__2 Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's "Hungry Again," and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's "I Still Miss Someone" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely "Will He Be Waiting For Me." This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.
__label__2 Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!
__label__1 Band saves CD: As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work.
__label__2 Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!
__label__2 The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
__label__2 non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!
__label__1 worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
__label__2 One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading.
__label__2 excellent: Good price, excellent design and shipped well.Would've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving.
__label__2 Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come.
__label__1 Maybe next time...: I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case.
__label__2 To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game.
__label__1 Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about. Sorry Core and Eidos, this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well. What a boost this could have been for you.
__label__1 Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
__label__1 Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book: This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!
__label__2 this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs (if insects can be called beautiful). The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.
__label__1 Good, but only to the midway point: This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.
__label__1 a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS.
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
__label__1 Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended.
__label__1 Well, not everything: It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of "real life" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a "good enough" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.
__label__1 Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
__label__1 Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of "executive summary" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
__label__2 The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies.
__label__2 Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it.
__label__1 elem diff e-q's: While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading.
__label__2 This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
__label__1 Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past.
__label__2 A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's "How to get control of time and your life", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.
__label__1 Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?: I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!
__label__2 Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.
__label__1 Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__2 The meaning of God, the meaning of life.: Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future.
__label__1 You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now.
__label__1 junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
__label__2 fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
__label__1 Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
__label__2 Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia.
__label__1 Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.
__label__1 Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.
__label__1 Stuck With You: I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.
__label__2 None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author.
__label__2 Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan.
__label__2 Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!
__label__1 lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!: First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together. No, really...they were. The printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them.
__label__1 Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
__label__2 Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn't expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening.
__label__1 broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
__label__1 Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the "ON" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the "OFF" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.
__label__1 Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?
__label__2 Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
__label__1 THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE, AND IT REALLY SUCKED!!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS, DON'T, IT'S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
__label__2 Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information
__label__2 LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.
__label__2 CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
__label__1 I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.
__label__1 More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of "Billy the Kid" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.
__label__1 waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!
__label__2 CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
__label__2 Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy, California is happy, and I'm happy.
__label__1 "THE ROCKETS RED GLARE" ???: This over-priced pain in "the sitting area" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug.
__label__2 Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of "shaky" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price
__label__2 A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled.
__label__1 Love Jerry and Dean, just not this version: I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection.
__label__1 Crap, Junk, Worthless, etc: The other 1-star poster is absolutely correct; these things are crap. I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn't seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless. I had high hopes for this toy because of my love for it when I was younger. As always, the quality of these "nostalgic" toys leave much to be desired (I'm looking at you, Evel Knievel Dare Devil Stunt Set!). The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper.
__label__2 Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles.
__label__2 I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: "For office slaves, Internet addicts and stressed-out students." (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved, but still want to feel better, relax and also rejuivinate, AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age, then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!
__label__2 An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
__label__1 not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me, don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it. The title is misleading.
__label__2 Typical Thomas video, all about James: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.
__label__1 Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand "new" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons.
__label__1 Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
__label__2 Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable.
__label__2 "Like this" by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic "clean up the ghetto". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it.
__label__1 A Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is "Buyer beware"
__label__2 A peek inside the process.: First thing's first, "Homespun" is an album of demos for "Apple Venus". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, "Skylarking" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for "Apple Venus". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts "River of Orchids" and "Green Man".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original ("Knights in Shining Karma"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out "Apple Venus", it's a fine record.
__label__2 As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work.
__label__2 a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read.
__label__1 Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software...
__label__2 Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!
__label__2 Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
__label__2 I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found "Quaker Oat Bran" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too.
__label__2 Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I'd just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT.
__label__2 Its a cable: Its a cable, it works, what else do you want? I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it. Yea!! But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for. Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market. who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.
__label__2 awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
__label__2 I'm grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising.
__label__2 Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian, I would say that "Lifetimes" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: "Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever." This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that "Lifetimes" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.
__label__2 Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me, I lost everything today,The only one, and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me.The cover of the Police's "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" is one of the more interesting covers I have ever heard.If you liked "From One" the buy this disc. I would love to see these guy live.
__label__1 USA1: Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
__label__2 Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one.
__label__1 This book is messed up: In this book, not only is there no real "love" scenes, but to top it off, the girl's cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded.
__label__2 Impressive: One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.
__label__2 The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
__label__1 Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises "hick" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), "The Mothman Prophecies" is a considerable disappointment.
__label__1 SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!: Let me just start by saying that the " MOTHMAN PROPHECIES" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead.
__label__1 And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don't mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining. This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title. There's hardly anything about "the mothman" in it.
__label__1 Mothman proficies ?: 257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70's UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else.
__label__1 Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don't know what this was. Holy mackeral. i've never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:" so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt." what!? I'm thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this "mysterious" guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote" was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control."what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush
__label__1 Are you joking?: I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction, right? There is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever: no science, no documentary or physical evidence, nothing! There are no MIBs (except in the movies), no secret "conspiracies" to hide evidence of alien visitations, no alien abductions,... absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true.Ask yourselves: If this is really true, then why, with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos, financial scandals, politcal dirty tricks, payoffs, espionage and intelligence screwups and the like, how any "conspiracy" of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation?It simply makes no sense. It is pure entertainment, nothing more.And you Five-Star reviewers have credit cards....?
__label__1 fine if you support terrorism: I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-"Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop" [reffering to LTTE snipers]"Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop"She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they're buying here.
__label__2 Good for afterwork cruising, better for airplane tranquility: Listening to this cd, I turned my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. The lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It does have a political overtone, but it's ok, I like the revolution type mood. It's actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head.
__label__1 What's the big deal?: The only thing interesting about this album is mia's accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music.
__label__2 Excellant: I love Kala as well, because it sounds cleaner and more developed. However this album was an excellant break out in her career. fire, fire is one of my favorites. Mix with marijuana.
__label__2 So Original, So Fun: A friend introduced me to this CD and it's quickly become a favourite. M.I.A.'s music so catchy and so fun to dance to, yet it's also lasting...I've been listening to it over and over. And I love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music.
__label__1 noritake colorwave stoneware: I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time.
__label__2 A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway.: Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's.
__label__2 Old age gold...: As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC.
__label__1 Tiene que ser sensilla!!: Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!
__label__1 Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.
__label__1 Worst book I've ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I "attempted" to read by the author, since I couldn't waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade.
__label__2 Frankenstein Continued??: When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist.
__label__1 Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous "Remove cassette" message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for "canon zr users group" and "eating tapes" to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders.
__label__1 My [Goodness]!!!!: world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv's, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!
__label__2 Lots of effects, lightweight & easy to use.: Awesome Camcorder & Camera functions in this lightweight, easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me, right out of the box. This camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects, and options to make really interesting video effects. I love this camcorder!
__label__2 excellent book for the novice improviser to the instructor: Izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging. His explaination of the games with goals, group size, time, process and variations for each of the games is very helpful. It is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his/her team thinking creatively, working on teamwork and self confidence. My only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it isn't long enough. Write another.
__label__2 hard -to-find tension rods: Our living room has a "bow" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
__label__2 YES, YES, YES great read: Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol
__label__2 A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
__label__2 Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided ,"hey why not?" now that i read this fab manga,theres no turning back!!!this is totally a keeper! i strongly recomend!!!!
__label__1 If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.: I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album, you probably already have all the songs on this album so don't waste your money. The only reason I would recommend someone to but this album is if they did not buy the box set. I wish I had my $10.00 back.
__label__1 Ehh: The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
__label__1 "True" Nirvana sucks: I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are "illegal". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is "true" Nirvana, then "true" Nirvana sucks.
__label__1 garbage: Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag.
__label__1 Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.
__label__2 Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I'm wanting matching in a smaller glass and can't seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these.
__label__2 Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more "Adventure! Action!" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!
__label__1 The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word "ficbe" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition.
__label__1 Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done.
__label__1 Lame Jujitsuka: I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.
__label__1 Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.
__label__2 Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third): In the forest of Midworld, one had better learn to hug close to one's home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants, animals, insects, and other beings less well categorized.Yet, despite a living space defined by various levels of Hell below and above, this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors. Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself. As much as possible on this planet, he's experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction.
__label__2 Best Alan Dean Foster book!: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one. It'll be fun, and you won't be able to put it down.After finishing this one, try hunting down "Dark Star", a movie-novelization that is almost as good as "Midworld".
__label__1 Plain Putrid: This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak.
__label__1 Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read "Tess" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on "Tess.."
__label__1 Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
__label__1 Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
__label__1 The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals.: Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards.
__label__2 Obligatory: My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
__label__2 Good Companion Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
__label__2 Great classic: I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations, albeit some self imposed.
__label__2 Beautifully written, dark Masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.: A beautifully written, dark masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl. Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich 'relatives' with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!
__label__1 I hated this book then....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that's done.
__label__1 Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor's edition. I guess I'll have to go back to B&N.
__label__1 Ummm: I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
__label__2 Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the "manned mission to Mars" genre.
__label__2 Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch 'Newland' in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.
__label__1 Please read Kundera's book instead: Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: "The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential."
__label__2 Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his "lightness of being".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out.
__label__2 Milan Kundera rides again...: A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded.
__label__1 Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
__label__1 The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler): Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident.
__label__1 disappointed: I have been very impressed by other "pickin on" music: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zep, Santana, to name a few I have. However, Hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly.
__label__2 The birth of Drone??: As far as I know,this predates anything else known as "drone" music,which seems to be a popular genre these days.This is about as psychedelic as it gets,your mind wandering out into the infinite void.So good.
__label__2 Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life.
__label__2 Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I'm only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it's like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water, and there is nothing else in it I couldn't pronounce. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it's like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in. The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!
__label__2 Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body--I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out.
__label__2 Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read "On The Road", "The Town and The City", and just before this one, "The Subterraneans", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer.
__label__2 On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.
__label__1 Flat Kerouac: I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.
__label__1 Self Indulgent Nonsense: The operative word from the title is "bums". This is a book about them and their self indulgent, self righteous idleness. A work with no redeeming features.
__label__1 Outlines of Theology, AA Hodge: Kindle edition: Very disappointed. The book is a great work, but there are so many unreadable words in the Kindle e-book edition that after a few pages of frustration, you finally give up trying. This product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable.
__label__2 Life changing!: This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
__label__1 not worth it: mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
__label__1 WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!
__label__1 Not really a good movie: This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth.
__label__2 transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
__label__2 Loved It!: I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
__label__2 Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME, the family loved it and was so very HAPPY to watch and enjoy on a great family evening, Thanks Bunches!
__label__2 TRANFORMERS DARK OF THE MOON: transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation
__label__1 1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness: When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd).
__label__2 Yeah: I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad.
__label__1 Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!: This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.
__label__1 instant video is mislabeling it's movies as 3d: I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn't 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it's not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection.
__label__1 Another 'video game' type of movie, Whyyy?: Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!
__label__1 Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one: No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored.
__label__1 Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
__label__1 Transformers: Dark of the Moon: By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than "Ooh, big robots and explosions!" But hey, for some, that's really all you need.
__label__1 The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.: The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck.
__label__1 The perfect movie, for a 12 yr old: I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life.
__label__1 Lights out on this awful film: I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as "immature" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.
__label__1 Not that great: The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok. The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed.
__label__1 Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12: I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description.
__label__2 Love this movie: Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
__label__1 Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie.
__label__2 Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.
__label__2 Transformers Dark of the Moon: A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
__label__1 Movie is ok, but..................: the title of the disk pack is totally wrong.It should be Blue Ray + DVD and digital copy available for DLa 210gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it, to me is lame.you enter a very long url, then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie, and get a error 404 website not foundI can get to any other web site I enter, but not to the Transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessed.Paramount should take lessons from Fox on how to include the digital copy
__label__2 Guys Movie: So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.
__label__1 Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!: I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?
__label__2 Transformers: Dark of the Moon: watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
__label__1 Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....: I know a lot of movies aren't going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest. Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful
__label__1 Safety pins: As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
__label__1 Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler: Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
__label__2 B-Movie-Licious: I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though.
__label__1 Hell no.: Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it, if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie.*Update:Marine II will star Ted Dibease HAHAHAHAHAHAH LOL!!!! pathetic.
__label__1 What a complete and utter waste of time, and money.: This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....
__label__1 Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!: I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today.
__label__2 Sony E-Marker is now obsolete: Excellent Product, but Sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of Sept so don't bother buying. Shame as it was really good while it lasted.
__label__2 good idea, good looks, needs lots of work: I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
__label__1 Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.
__label__1 worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to "enable" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.
__label__1 Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.
__label__1 Sony has pulled the plug: Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them.
__label__1 Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
__label__1 Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.
__label__1 Artwork???: Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
__label__1 Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.
__label__1 "I Can Read" book has better illustrations: While the stories in the "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, "In A Dark, Dark Room", which was written for Level 2 of the "I Can Read!" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."
__label__1 The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...: I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the "scary" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it's a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator.
__label__1 Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to "freestyle" and "improvisation". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy.
__label__1 Tongue hurt my ankle: The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn't matter which sock I wore. I had to return.
__label__1 Buy the 1993 version instead.: I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive "pamphlet" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.
__label__2 Protection Advice: All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction.
__label__1 know the source of your information: While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive.
__label__2 Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.: We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that, in addition to having great scenes of the Dingle countryside, it also has a very good story line. And, terrific acting and some Irish history thrown in for good measure.
__label__2 Viewed it yesterday: This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
__label__1 Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean.
__label__2 Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie. The seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though I was buying from a friend. Way to do business!!
__label__1 it sounds great!~!~!~!~!: it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
__label__2 It's a very reliable printer...: I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is, if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card, you don't have to be connected to your PC. Just know which numbers you want to print, enter and off it goes. The quality of my prints has been great. Right now it's connected to my iMac and is doing splendidly. It's quite dependable and not expensive. I'd recommend it highly.*****
__label__1 Grindhouse?: I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
__label__1 Am I missing something?: Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it), but for the horrible way it displays on my iPad.The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?
__label__2 Is honesty always rewarded ?: Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!
__label__2 LOVE THIS BOOK: I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
__label__2 Awesome if not overplayed: The first 5 songs are incredible, and the rest are OK. I live in France and Chumbawamba never got really big there so I haven't heard tubthumping a zillion times, which makes it still interesting to listen to.
__label__2 A Great CD for all people: I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus, the trumpet playing is great! I also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together. This is truly a masterpiece
__label__2 Beyond the mega-hit, preview of better things to come: Besides the much maligned mega-hit "Tubthumping" which I didn't like when it was first released but like now, this is a solid CD with great arrangements, lyrics, and performances. It's not perfect but how many CD's are perfect these days? I have recently discovered "Ready Mades and Then Some" - clearly a 5-star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song. Masterfully done. I won't write a song-by-song critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that. However, I do put forward a challenge to "rtbarry" in AZ to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a "review", if he is capable, to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this CD that rates it only one star? Or, does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were Kim Jong-il of North Korea? Otherwise, "rtbarry" don't waste our time with drivel.
__label__2 It's Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
__label__1 The One Star: The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd.
__label__1 I won't buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in "best" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!
__label__1 Non Computer Geek: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER, I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it, after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix, I just got this printer and it is even worse, it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box, the copy was consistantly misaligned. I am sending it back.
__label__1 Curved Thomas the Train tracks: Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones.
__label__1 O-o-okay: Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she'll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!
__label__2 Heads above the first book in the trilogy: I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book.
__label__2 Good book: I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history.
__label__2 Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan.
__label__2 Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change.
__label__1 Good politics, but no science: The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.
__label__2 Asimow is one of the best writers of all times: Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books.
__label__2 Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!
__label__1 Don't Bother: Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish.
__label__1 tough going: I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!
__label__1 Dissatified: I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story.
__label__1 Goes "Haywire" Regularly: Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!
__label__2 Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it.
__label__1 Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
__label__1 worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!
__label__1 Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2.
__label__1 LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
__label__1 What did I watch?: So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
__label__2 Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?
__label__2 If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land ("Welcome to Mongolia!" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.
__label__1 Banal and Boring: No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say "nearly," because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...
__label__2 GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
__label__2 Amazing Score.: Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!
__label__1 Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it.
__label__2 Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
__label__1 It's too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of "dummie" and "KISS" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste.
__label__2 Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.
__label__1 awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
__label__2 Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.
__label__1 Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called "classic" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me.
__label__2 entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
__label__2 one more positive note: Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.
__label__1 Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue.
__label__2 This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as "The Road Warrior." And "The Road Warrior" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today."Mad Max" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the "action hero" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.
__label__2 Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'
__label__1 AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!
__label__2 Oh, my God! It's Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song "Revolution 9" from the "White Album." I could've just imagined while listening to "Baby Lulu" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)
__label__2 Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!
__label__2 Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
__label__2 Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!
__label__2 Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
__label__2 Well Played Kid's Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own.
__label__1 Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!
__label__2 well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn't put it down! if u haven't read it yet, do so!
__label__1 Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
__label__2 Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual "guide." The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!
__label__2 These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, "Merrills are a hug for the feet." Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them.
__label__2 Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.
__label__2 Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
__label__2 You'll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc.
__label__2 Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of "Lament" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song "Beuonos Aires" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.
__label__2 EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
__label__1 Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.
__label__2 A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.
__label__1 A small leak, right out of the box: I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this.
__label__1 Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed.
__label__2 It's a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it's firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties.
__label__2 Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.
__label__2 comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone.
__label__1 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
__label__2 Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
__label__2 Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.
__label__1 Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years.
__label__1 It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress.
__label__1 Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality.
__label__2 Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.
__label__1 WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM.
__label__1 Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is "save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on", that's what we're doing now.
__label__2 Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!
__label__1 Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.
__label__2 Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
__label__2 Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.
__label__2 Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.
__label__2 Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn't have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn't get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it's very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate.
__label__2 Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
__label__2 Its better then a "normal" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.
__label__1 Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
__label__2 Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.
__label__2 great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
__label__1 Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.
__label__1 Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.
__label__2 The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
__label__2 Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.
__label__2 Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!
__label__2 Step's Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD "Standing Room Only." "I'm So Glad" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a "must buy" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.
__label__2 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn't get the best air so I'd recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]
__label__2 DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
__label__1 Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
__label__2 good: It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!
__label__1 Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY
__label__1 No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
__label__1 Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.
__label__2 GREAT prodct: For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.
__label__1 Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.
__label__1 Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.
__label__1 Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the "bunny ears" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product.
__label__1 HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum "my first vibrator" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more "lifted" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!
__label__2 After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.
__label__1 I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.
__label__2 Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
__label__2 Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her "dialouges" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like "Evergreen" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), "The Music of the Night" , & "Somewhere" (not favorable with Il Divo)
__label__1 Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...
__label__1 misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the "too good to be true" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.
__label__1 Waste of money: If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!
__label__1 What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
__label__1 Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 "generations" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.
__label__1 Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.
__label__2 Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
__label__2 Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.
__label__1 Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
__label__2 A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.
__label__1 RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!
__label__1 Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.
__label__1 How do films like this get made?: If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!
__label__1 What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!
__label__1 Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better.
__label__1 Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!
__label__1 no color, no buy: I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!
__label__2 Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!
__label__1 Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? "Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!
__label__1 A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson "in his own words" but were nothing more than fabrication.
__label__1 MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook."The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.
__label__1 Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.
__label__1 REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said "man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.
__label__1 sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.
__label__1 Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!
__label__1 Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However "Hope" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
__label__2 A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
__label__2 A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.
__label__2 One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing "object" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read
__label__2 GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I've been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON.
__label__2 Great space heater!: It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it.
__label__2 Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of "Portrait of a Marriage" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call "The Three V's." The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.
__label__1 Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
__label__1 This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.
__label__1 Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The "auto" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.
__label__2 a childhood favorite: In "The Greengage Summer" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.
__label__2 Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320: This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market.
__label__2 Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book
__label__2 Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the "natural disaster" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too
__label__2 Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy.
__label__1 complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box.
__label__1 bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)
__label__1 does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
__label__1 Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
__label__1 Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap.
__label__1 Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago ("limited" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider "fixing", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone.
__label__2 Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as "Discontinued". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.
__label__2 Top Notch Christmas Jazz: I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard, elevator jazz.
__label__1 review: The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow.
__label__1 Wow: I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: "Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD.
__label__2 Basketball, not at its best: Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while
__label__1 never again: I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money.
__label__1 Reaching for the Light: I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
__label__1 Hardly worth reading: This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read.
__label__2 Statin levels: Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption.
__label__1 DECEPCIONADO: Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería "el libro" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil
__label__1 Excellent show, poor sound: Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina's fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget "Amsterdam" and don't miss "One Last Time in Concert" as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show...
__label__2 Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow): Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,"Great God Pan",their Sabbath cover of "A National Acrobat"(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic "The Forest Of Koncerei".A real keeper.
__label__1 It does not use your classification for the musics.: I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device.
__label__1 Returned the View twice in one week: I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems.
__label__1 Worst mp3 player on the market.: I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please, please do not waste your money & time on this product. I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it.
__label__2 Nice Device: This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 , yes Sansa View 8 GB MP3 280. While everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on Black Friday they didn't see the tiny small icons around the today's deal page. If you use a computer you should be able to tranfer sound & images files without using a program. It's basic computer 101. I use Sony's SonicStage myself. Records at 192 for crisp sound.
__label__2 This player is very very good: Wow, this has been one of the best products I bought, with great sound, great quality pictures in the video, easy to load files into memory, compatible with WMP, it also brings a player-Sync in the installation cd . I like, I take all Pareto, I plug in the car, sounds very hard, is extremely friendly to navigate between playlists. Presntacion has several languages''. The Spanish translation used is very good and relevant, unlike others who say one thing and mean another. I recommend
__label__1 Don't buy without a good return policy.: This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
__label__1 Don't buy this piece of crap: I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!
__label__1 Nothing is from scratch?: Why on Earth would "nothing is made from scratch" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good, simple cooking, look into Mark Bittman's cookbooks.
__label__2 Really funny and exciting: I'd say this book is extremely informative for the responsible, occasional sit at home drug user. I read it and learned a few things about the law I didn't know about. Definately a must read for anyone who uses any drugs whether it be a little or a lot. If you're a dealer it gives you an outlook of legal information, but one of the author's commandments in the book is "Thou shall not sell" which every dealer already knows. The only rule for dealers is DON'T GET CAUGHT.
__label__2 Good book: Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
__label__2 Great History: I am a big fan of Ms. Blake's but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you're a fan of people and their cultures, you might want to give this book a try.
__label__2 Handy card holders: I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards, which, since I have small hands and am also a klutz, I drop a lot and mix up. The card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone. They are also slightly curved to prevent other players from "accidentally" seeing your cards. A very good deal for klutzes everywhere.
__label__1 It does the job: If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game.
__label__2 Buy this now!: Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there's the content -- top notch stuff, perfect.
__label__2 Forward the Mage an Alternate Style: Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in "Joe's World" is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking "where is the rest of this story", this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume.
__label__2 Fantasy writing at its best: Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer, arrest, and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival. Both feature fast-paced action and complex, believable settings.
__label__1 A device grows old: Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti & the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up.
__label__2 Cool Documentary: I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don't let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection. I've watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters.A must buy for anyone serious about competitive DH racing. Shred it up all!
__label__1 Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships: This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a "Nimitz"-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a "great" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.
__label__1 Jabra Eargels: The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
__label__1 Jabra Ear Gels: These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!
__label__1 What a waste: Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these.
__label__2 Fast delivery, great product: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.
__label__1 JABRA EAR GELS: Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
__label__2 jabra eargels: These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them.
__label__1 Not well suited for the Jawbone II: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.
__label__1 pain in the ear: They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped.
__label__2 JEG: The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
__label__1 scottiesgems: I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won't work.
__label__1 This movie is not all that: originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T
__label__1 Hmmmmmmm: I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well, but his part was boring. As well as the rest of the movie. Scylla looks like 1930's cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn't even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn't worth a penny in my book!
__label__1 Crap, all crap: ...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn't get his way, creepy Athena, who's eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won't fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!
__label__2 The Odyssey with Armand Asanti: I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
__label__1 Great movie, but what's with the price?: I have seen this movie before, and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom, but...why the heck is it $99? It's good, but not THAT good!
__label__1 Very BORING: This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.
__label__2 Birds, Beasts and Relatives: As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go.
__label__1 I Don't Think So!: Quite often, bringing a classic story like "Moby Dick" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did.
__label__1 The white whale isn't: The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic & you can't do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.
__label__1 Did not fit in ear: I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there.
__label__2 Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.
__label__2 The Face of a Stranger: Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, "The Face of a Stranger" which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book.
__label__1 Waste of time and money: I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture, bedding, hard to reach spaces,etc. And a month later I still have fleas. It is a major waste of time and money.
__label__1 This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.: When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world.
__label__1 I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...: I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don't have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!
__label__1 very much disappointed: It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View.
__label__2 A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!: A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure, this film is heartwarming and inspiring. It is also funny and pleasant. BUT it is also sexy, very sexy infact! And it is very enjoyable and entertaining. 5 stars!
__label__1 Terrible movie: I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, "we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man." All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character.
__label__1 Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....: What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed. The writing is unimpressive, the story is dull and far fetched, and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot. What was the point? They seemed to have forgotten to find one.
__label__1 under the Tuscany Sun: Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie.
__label__2 Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!: In this movie, as with life(usually),our "plans" from our "beginnings", don't work out like we think they will.[If yours have and you are one of the those living your dreams, twenty, fifty, etc. years later, I'm sure you are counting your blessings! ;)]Frances' "new" story begins when she acts on instinct instead of "planning" and thus life begins, rather unexpectedly to Frances, to have its own "design" for her life. She has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become. Little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for. However, as in true life, it may not be in the way you expect it.A truly, inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, but I probably couldn't use my fingers to count, even if I counted each of them twice!Also, must mention Diane Lane, Sandra Oh, you guys are the best!
__label__1 Diane Lane is great but skip this movie: Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.
__label__2 Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS: I think it's always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a "replacement substitute". The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours.
__label__1 Here's what really happened...: The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version, jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history. The result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executive's decisions are made. I think he did a good job.
__label__1 A failure of "Battlefield Earth" proportions!: I should say, "worse than Battlefield Earth proportions!" This whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go, "why?" Everything about this convoluted, sarcastic, beefed up, badly edited tripe is confusing to watch, poorly executed and loses you 10 minutes into the film. You are introduced to boring characters, cliched camera angles and material we all know John Mcteirnan is far more capable of. I was thankful I got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks! If you really want to see the real "Rollerball" rent (don't buy) the original. The original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud-James Caan! He's a legend man!! I don't know what kind of future Chris Klein has in movies but as far as action movies go, let's just put it this way, we already have Keanu Reeves and quite bluntly, he's a much better actor. Steer clear and save your money!
__label__1 TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!: This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star.
__label__1 Horrible.: I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
__label__1 ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.: I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would.
__label__1 Junk, need I say more JUNK: This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other's brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it's previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it's really really really NOT!Trust me don't waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don't believe you should waste your time!
__label__2 I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!: I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my "go-to" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again.
__label__2 concisely written: This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
__label__1 What the????: It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!
__label__1 When Good Products Go Bad: I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product.
__label__1 Very disappointed: Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again.
__label__2 Very large: These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine.
__label__1 dont get it: Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
__label__1 Not a good toy: This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
__label__2 JBL MRX512M: JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new "opened" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product.
__label__1 Good for downhill only: I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!
__label__2 Pratchetts Best!!!!: Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works, I left all my classic German literature aside and started reading and reading and reading... . But this book, "Small Gods", has beaten everything I've read before (even my all-time favorite "Faust" - you know: the Goethe one). It is witty, intelligent and above all deaply questioning. I remained nodding all the time:"Yes, that's what I always believed religion is about."
__label__2 Pratchett Review Haiku: I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
__label__1 Why do people like this garbage?: Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.
__label__1 Boring plot.: I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic.
__label__1 cross contamination: The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great "silent damage" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet.
__label__2 Just Accepting Gluten Free Life: I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone's opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven't read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out.
__label__1 Terrible!: My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease.
__label__1 get the facts: Most of the people who gave shining, sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel. It is not boring. Jax is a talented writer, I'll give her that. But when I read on page 394 that the perscription drugs I was on and had been on for 5 years (both Pfizer drugs) were not GF I was seriously troubled.Many follow-ups with both Pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is.I went off my meds immediately thinking I was injesting gluten. I suffered the undue consequences of going off "cold turkey" when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book. If you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read, but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt, as they say.Jax was indeed very lax when writing this book.
__label__2 Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !: What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy! To your health!
__label__1 Not useful and a waste of money: The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
__label__1 Devoid of depth or even much substance: The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a "forest" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. "Raising Your Spirited Child" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.
__label__1 Try something else.: I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters.
__label__2 Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.: Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side.
__label__1 Less than one star.: Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!
__label__1 Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game: I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other.
__label__2 Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise: A regular nail biter: strong plotlines, excellent cast give relaible performances, killer locations. Sci-fi what-if horror flick with a twist. Who knew Tim Hutton was a sci-fi fan? Nice uncomplicated performance.,
__label__2 A Must Have: For those familiar with the Burzum name, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is largely and widely accepted as his crowning achievement. Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period.
__label__2 Super Reader: An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings.
__label__1 Politics?: A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.
__label__2 A Must for Handgunners - Old and New: This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment.
__label__1 Lousy Camera: This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally "twisted".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one.
__label__1 Piece of junk: Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
__label__2 Video too!: I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
__label__2 Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the "best" of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing "Jamie", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: "My World is Empty Without You" and "Forever Came Today". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!
__label__2 Great true crime read: I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read.
__label__1 static central: Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with.
__label__1 I expected something better: EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper.
__label__1 Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first "click" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones.
__label__1 Freud is crazy!: I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.
__label__2 If life is a dream, then don't wake me up: This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work.
__label__2 It arriived: Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
__label__2 Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory.
__label__2 When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?: Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires.
__label__1 Amazon.com sent wrong size: Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
__label__2 One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death.
__label__2 Janet, is the Best female singer!: I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang "I get Lonely", "Nasty" and "You", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!
__label__2 Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a "must have" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!
__label__2 Captivating: Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this "glued to my seat" book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when's the next one.....
__label__2 Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.: Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her "participants" are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key.
__label__2 Great Information: My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
__label__2 Good Overview and Very Informative: I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace. I highly recommend this DVD.
__label__2 Superb!: When I was 5 months pregnant, I'm desperate to take Child Birth Class in order to help me have Normal Delivery. I searched over the net the best detailed class. Voila! I came accross this product on one of my searches. I never had second thoughts of ordering this product. I regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on DVD. It really works! I had an easy labor plus I had Normal Delivery. Superb! I recommend this DVD for those who wanted a Modern and comprehensive Child Birth Class. - Margery Bermejo (Davao City, Philippines)
__label__2 Chilbirth Education Video: Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
__label__1 TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest.
__label__2 GO FOR IT!: This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!
__label__2 LOVED this video!: After I bought this DVD, I watched it about 8 times on my own and with my husband before our son was born. We both laughed at Sheri's mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her. We both felt more prepared, even though we weren't able to attend birthing classes.
__label__2 RECOMMEND!: I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do, right? Well, this DVD was great! It saved me from paying over $100 for a lamaze class and I felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect. I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It's a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class. (I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, b/c they should really look into updating it soon).
__label__1 Couldn't finish watching: Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we've learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter's sense of humor, you'll benefit from the information - good luck!
__label__2 very informative: Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information, and humorous all at the same time !!!
__label__2 Poignant & Intelligent -- give this one a listen!: Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable, bonafide talent -- one of life's genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of Montana. In a way I am [selfishly] sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success -- I was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself.
__label__2 Exquisitely fresh, jazzy & melodius, crisp & classy!: Mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a Native American dance, a smokey Nashville nightclub, a cruise with the whales...hints of Paul Consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation, a journey through the 20th Century...and back again into the lonely Montana night where Ron strolls with star gazing abandon.
__label__1 At least it's free: I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though...
__label__2 Yardbirds: Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story, but never the complete picture.
__label__2 One of my favorites...: ...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in "Revenge". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, "got-nothing-else-to-do" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
__label__2 Nice French farce, similar to 'un elephant': Showed this film to my French class, and it was a hit. The same actors as in Jean de Florette, but about 20 years later. Thoroughly enjoyable.
__label__2 Daniel Auteuil is fabulous: I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
__label__1 This book is AWEFUL: I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended.
__label__2 Captivating and Engrossing: When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel.
__label__2 Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!: I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought "another one of your lousy stories" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence.......
__label__2 one of the best series EVER!!!: When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!
__label__1 Giants Mats: The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
__label__2 Exactly what I ordered: Product arrived on time, in great condition. As usual, Amazon provided a vehicle to acquire a product that I wanted.
__label__2 Touching: Beautiful film, excellent acting. The story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions. These are real people with real issues, another example of life being stranger than fiction, as portrayed in a film. Hope there's a Part II. :)
__label__2 One of the best foreign language films: For once, a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse.Suzanne Bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films "Things we lost in the fire" and "Brothers".
__label__2 Wonderfully emotional.: Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
__label__1 The remix is different: I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don't sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not.
__label__1 Why the remix?: If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10, not replace the original album mix like Mushroom is doing here. This new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs. Wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it.
__label__1 Art and Passion...but no Science: A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport.
__label__1 No illustrations: The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me.
__label__1 No drawings!: I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book, one that is illustrated.
__label__2 what hard rock is all about: Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis.
__label__2 Thuvia maid of mars: Typical ERB Mars series, which I find light reading. Not too much depth or thought provoking, but nice escape from everyday.
__label__1 Old-School Bore Metal: This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal, with all songs sounding the same. Mid-paced tempos and simplistic solos abound, with moronic wayyyyy-out-of-date pretend-satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Want real thrash metal, aside from the Big Four? Try Coroner, Arch Enemy, Arsis, The Crown, the Haunted, Hypocrisy, and a ton of others that poop all over this album from miles above.
__label__1 Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients: If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that, but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation. I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and couldn't clean or quarantine it! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients. To me this is false advertising!!!
__label__2 A new beginning...: This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!
__label__1 Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item: Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you.
__label__1 It's an ad.: This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber's school/store in CakeEater, MN. There is no "How To" advise in this book.
__label__2 A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it: A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author, Jesse Stuart.I think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure. My favorite story was Snake Teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure. I would recommend this book for 9 yrs.-adults because normally after 9 years of age you will understand the dialect in this book.
__label__1 Flyboys: Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film.
__label__2 World War I aviation visited: I have enjoyed watching "Flyboys" several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end. I noticed that one of the people interviewed was from Colorado and as a result I went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie.I find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it.
__label__2 fly boys: i haven't watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review, i thought this would be something that he would enjoy.
__label__1 Sappy and Stupid: This is a very bad movie. Bad music, bad acting, bad special effects. A slow and predictable plot line. Glad we borrowed it and didn't buy this one!
__label__2 This CD Rulez: I think that this is one of the best CD's ever. I really like the song "Gravity" and "Next Time". Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must.
__label__2 "Souless Pop?" Not here: When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the "lou pearlman" sound to it. (remember o-town??" This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don't need anyone- 3Feelin' You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*
__label__2 Thank God: I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables, taking in consideration of the Lord's geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus' followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God.
__label__1 getting tired of the cliche: Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn't help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened. Hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen, and the next thing you know, someone has dropped. It is okay to see it for free, but not worth it when you pay for the ticket.
__label__1 shameful ripoff: even in the hour plus ''build-up/charactor developement''.i guess talky,anti american ''horror'' movies is the latest trend.i was watching the talky trailer on my computer and got sleepy.
__label__1 Great movie, horrible DVD!: Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film.
__label__1 How STUPED can you GET!: I'll tell you how stuped you can get, this movie is how stuped you can get. This is one of the STUPEDEST movie I have ever seen and trust me I've seen alot of movies.The whole movie is dumb exspecailly the actors.I recamend you not see this movie actshoally I more than recamend you I BEG you not to see this movie But if you incest to I recamend you borrow it from a friend your if you can't, rent it at the cheapest place you no before wasting your money on buying it. But if I were you I won't wast my money at all.
__label__2 Mighty Ducks rulz: This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!
__label__1 What's this?...: When i first heard his single "One Wish" i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing.
__label__1 raydiation: Thank God he stopped rapping, but now this album sucks too! Glad it was free. He's reppin' Cali too- oh hell no! The crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like R. Kelly and Timberland and they did him wrong! There are only three tight songs numbers 3, 4 and 5, all were produced by Rodney Jerkins, he can't be his sister though, this album proves Ray J just ain't got it, maybe he could if he had just stuck with using Rodney Jerkins. But the beats are not supposed to make you tight, your supposed to make that beat what it is and more.
__label__2 WELL DONE RAY J.: This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J.
__label__2 Stew: Well I am.... I have to say in all honesty.... A true Magnum fan, In the past I followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best, which was in my own personal opinion...All the time ! Vigilante is certainly one of Magnum`s finest example`s of good solid heavy rock on any one given Cd ! "Need a lot of Love" is one of there finest along with "Vigilante" of coarse ! And there is also track`s like "Lonely Night" and "Midnight" on there too ! I personally have all Magnum`s Cd`s as I`m so into there genre of music and culture ! I Simply could`nt be without ! But if you like a bit of Live in concert Magnum then i recomend that You get you`re hand`s on Magnum`s "Live" cd !
__label__1 don't waste your money: I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness. What I got was a book with stories (I read 3 of them before I gave up)that had to be written by horney 13 year olds. This single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to Amazon.
__label__2 Brilliant reinvention: Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It's a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you're just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch.
__label__1 Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT: This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The "mystery" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying.
__label__1 Too bad it's boring: The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.
__label__2 carnivale: Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky, the dancers and the band. The whole concert was great and really entertaining, it felt so much like Carnivale.
__label__1 Once again, a great book chopped up like onions.: At a wimpy 85 minutes, so much is left out that unless you've read the book, a lot of what is happening probably won't make any sense.Avoid the movie, but definitely read the book by my favorite author Douglas Kennedy
__label__1 Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb: After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books.
__label__1 Don't bother!: This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with "Into Thin Air" or "The Climb". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is.
__label__1 This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...: ...it's about being "proud of being the first Danish woman to do so" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended
__label__2 Best Show Around: Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???), it's worth buying simply to watch George Eads the whole way through. He's so hot. The combination of a good cast and interesting (if not often creepy) storylines, keeps me watching this show each and every week and I could watch all of these episodes over and over. Go out and buy this now. It will get you hooked.
__label__2 cj: It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
__label__2 This is a great game for rookies, champs, and bored kids!: This game is fun, exciting, and easy to learn how to play. I got this for Christmas last year, and I still love to play. Trust me, I have a very short attention span and a complex mind and found this game great.Pros:*cool monsters to raise*tournaments to win*many secret breeds to unlock*many tasks to accomplish*lots of monsters to pick from*challenging for pro gamers*enjoyable for untalented gamers*rules aren't confusing*good graphicsCons:*people talk a lot*monsters only have 4-5 year life spansThis game is varied so that a variety of people can enjoy. At first it is Ahhh,uhhh, okay. Then once you understand, it becomes great fun.I had this game in fifth grade and my friend and I shared so much laughter and good memories. This is a good game for anyone, so try it.
__label__1 From the biggest CULT of all!: So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?
__label__1 Pro?! Huh?: Not detail in explaining conceptsToo few numerical examplesContent far too simple to be a desktop ref. in the dealing rm.Poor editing and formatting90% similar to the earlier edition.
__label__2 Good, but not great: When I first heard this album I loved it. After listening to it more closely, I still like it a lot, but am not quite so blown away by it. When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn't aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, "Phobos."
__label__1 I gave it a try...: Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original, but in this case that's not necessairly a good thing. If you're not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn't be the best album to start with.
__label__1 Does not work on Windows XP!: Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center, but I have XP Pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution. I suspect that it's like another game we purchased that worked fine when XP first came out, but Windows Auto Update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old Win 98 games like this.We have it up and running on an 11 year old laptop with Win 98 , but it's too CPU intensive to run properly on that old thing.The game seems OK for the right PC and operating system though...
__label__2 if you love cats,get this!!: I have had this book for awhile,now,and the only thiong I dont care for are the colored charts...I just cant do them,as a LOT of people cant,especially the older we get. I have a ginger tabby named Sassy who looks just like the cat on the cover...she is draped over a sofa....having that piece will forever remind me of her after she is no longer here to drape over the couch.....You wont be disappointed if you can get by the colored charts. In fact I gave it 4 stars because of the colored charts....
__label__1 terrible: Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
__label__2 "Hope" may be a wrong concept.: I wonder, does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like Orwell did... He had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation. That's very interesting
__label__2 A timeless classic that's an unforgettable must-read.: This is the timeless classic which the term "Orwellian" and"Big Brother" are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government "Big Brother" holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell's vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen
__label__2 1984: Orwell's futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence, which allow them to be safe with each other. They found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without "Big Brother" watching their every move, it's ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives. I enjoyed reading this novel. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Orwell.
__label__1 1984: 1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*.
__label__1 Not a helpful history book AT ALL: I was doing a research paper on the year 1984, and according to my teacher, NONE of this actually happened.I got a flippin' F.Last time I ever read a history book by this Orwell scrub.He doesn't know a thing about the 80s.Not ONCE did he mention Def Leppard or Karma Chameleon.I gave my copy to a donkey.He said it was about communism.Ass.
__label__2 TEACHERS??: I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history.
__label__2 If you haven't read it, you owe it to yourself: I just read this for the first time at 28. Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with "Room 101" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.
__label__2 Scary!: George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too, if you got off the TV and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they're passing.I hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end.
__label__2 disturbing and relevant: I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies. Chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this. "I've repeatedly found," he says, "that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated, I can skip lots of the background ... because it's already obvious and taken for granted by everyone." Curious?
__label__2 The greatest work of the 20th Century: What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in.
__label__2 Orwel Rolls in His Grave: This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn't want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly..
__label__2 A Thoughtful Read: Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else.
__label__2 The title should be revised to say 2004!: With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these "mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed" changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves.
__label__1 George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that "Brave New World" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time.
__label__2 two plus two makes FOUR!!!!: George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton's hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing. As I read I saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but I couldn't put this book down.
__label__2 A Very Interesting Read: At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to "1984"
__label__2 Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.: I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us "We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!" they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. "We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears." Orwell would've been so proud.
__label__1 Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...: OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card.
__label__1 1984: I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time.
__label__2 masterpiece: I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course, whether that was Orwell's intent I don't know (though he was an atheist), but I think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope
__label__2 1984 as true today as in 1948: For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while.
__label__2 I thought the book was great.: I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.
__label__2 When Already?: Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?
__label__1 Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.: I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light, since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back.
__label__1 :\: If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries, light would NOT shut off. I figured I would just "break" the lights since I only needed the fan. Well before I could do that, the fan went out.
__label__2 Like silky, velvet dreams: The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.
__label__1 He isn't what I remember.: The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed.
__label__1 Need to proof read your work: This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
__label__1 NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER: hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again.
__label__1 Waste of money: I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter).
__label__2 It is what is......: West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be, West coast Gangsta music. It's all about lowridin, smokin chronic, kickin' it and gangbangin in the Golden State. Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It's a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it's still worth buying. It's got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That's Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars
__label__2 Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne's Best!: Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works, in my opinion. Many people were turned off by the film adaptation (why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me <eg>) but this book focuses on the relationship of Master and Slave and what happens when the tables are turned. Anne has many sides and Lestat is just one of them. True Rice Fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction.
__label__2 Wonderful story coupled with steamy, erotic scenes.: This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!
__label__1 Stick with Sleeping Beauty: Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)
__label__1 Vile from the beginning: Let me start by saying that I never put down a book, even if I don't like it. This is one that I couldn't even get past the first few pages. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book. I'm glad it was a free download on Kindle. I gave it two stars only because I didn't give it a chance to get better. If I hadn't deleted it, maybe I would give it another chance, but I certainly won't pay for it.
__label__1 spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.: shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin
__label__2 Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space: Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13, 2008The plot is typical Noir, the hero typical world-weary and disillusioned Hammett orChandler, but the atmosphere is stunning!It was a whole new world for me and I fellcompletely into it from Vinnie's first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion.Mr. Moore's descriptions of Thailand andthe Thai people are evocative and real. Onecan feel the heat and humidity, see the swirlsand flashes of colors, and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages. And the story's not bad either. I was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in Bangkok - and the story's not bad either. There were a confusing numberof characters, some of whom did not advance the plot at all, and the plotting could have been tighter, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend the book. Just be sure you read it in an air-conditioned space, because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat!
__label__1 I HATE THIS BOOK: I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
__label__1 Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?: If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published
__label__1 NOT THAT GOOD: Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
__label__2 Start memorizing this book.: I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that.
__label__2 dystopian classic: Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb. If you enjoyed "1984", "Brave New World", or "The Giver", you must read this. It is now one of my favorites!
__label__2 really good: this was a good book. the part called "coca"is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like "the giver" only a lot better.
__label__2 What a classic: To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It's the best $.25 you will ever spend.
__label__1 Didn't Like it!!: Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time.
__label__2 A book with many levels: What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books, with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech. The book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms. A very thought provoking novel.
__label__2 Fahrenheit 451: I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D
__label__1 Great Book to read, but NOT to LISTEN to.: I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's.
__label__1 DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!: This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow, and the characters are stupid. Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who sets books on fire, becuase homes are fireproof. Then he meets this crazy girl nmaed Clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like (Did you know that one time billboards were only 20 feet long, instead of 200) WHO CARES?!?! If there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this.
__label__1 Hardly even deserves 1 star: This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?
__label__2 Captivating language, needless to say amazing.: Being only a teenager, what I have to say usually means nothing, or gets no credit. I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone. You don't need to love to read, just know how to read.
__label__2 Ok: I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.
__label__2 Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!: I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the "future" and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read.
__label__2 Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the "dumbing of America" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country).
__label__2 It'll never go out of date: I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say "transcends the genre" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?
__label__1 Bleak, Blind, and Boring.: Being forced to read it in school for its "so called"relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can't say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r.
__label__1 Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain: I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering "wait... what happened?". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound.
__label__1 Sadly a disappointment: Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did.
__label__2 F 451 shows how dangerous a person's ideas are.: I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general
__label__2 A must read - especially for teenagers.: This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too). It is hard to believe that this book was written in the 1950's.
__label__1 poor reading: I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!
__label__2 Good: "Fahrenheit 451" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5
__label__2 Explains a lot of things from the movie: The book was not so good as the movie, but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when I saw it.Compared to 1984 it's miles away, but still is really nice.
__label__1 Fahrenheit 451: This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the "TV family" which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book.
__label__1 Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book, it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks, the whole worlds sucks, and burn books. I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out. He meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense, this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught. He then has to burn his books. He doesnt want to go to jail so he Runs away.
__label__1 BURN THIS BOOK!: Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!
__label__1 A Very Dark and Mysterious Book: I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book.
__label__1 I tried reading this book for my summer reading & it was bad: I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student. If you have a choice I wouldn't pick this one.
__label__1 WASTE OF MY TIME: first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on, i could write a book, about books,ten times better then that. maybe if the books had names and talked then maybe it would of caught my attention.
__label__1 This is the lamest book I have ever read: This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
__label__1 Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic.
__label__2 real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)
__label__2 INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!: This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?
__label__2 motorola phone car charger: product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient
__label__2 It worked: Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
__label__2 Well made product at fair price: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.
__label__1 Not so good: It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source.
__label__1 battle weary: This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don't waste your money.
__label__2 chalinging game: this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it, and I have had it for two mothes. I reconmend for only skilled players play.DELTA 904thanks for youre time and patience
__label__1 Horrible Game: This game is boring. You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it.
__label__1 why oh why does anyone play this: Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!
__label__2 The Code of Dusty Fog: I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites, but it fills in some of the story line. I will be rereading the book. I have all of the Floating Outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how I purchase them.
__label__1 Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz: I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character "melts".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library.
__label__2 I Kept Waking Up My Husband......: I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.
__label__2 High Quality For a Reasonable Price: I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised.
__label__1 Hallmark of the disposable society?: Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So, folks after 12 hours they are obsolete, and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia! Yay, hooray!
__label__1 NO AVAILABILITY: My rating is for Amazon, not the product. I placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available. Why is the availability not updated? I still see it being available now. Very disappointing
__label__1 poor quality DVD recording: movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but grainy.I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__2 Interesting View Into British Culture: As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
__label__2 Colin Firth...need one say more?: Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate, consumate actor in a variety of roles. A delightful diet of films...one a day plus a bonus for the week-end and one can have a film festival all their own!!
__label__2 Ones to watch over and over: Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.
__label__1 Sweet Revenge: This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn't watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.
__label__1 Not worth the great price: Paying about $16 for this collection of 8 films could have been a great buy. I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough.
__label__1 Warning. I HIGHLY don't recommend this set!: You would have NO idea reading the description, and looking at the picture on the front, but most of these movies have a rating of PG-13, and there's even an R!!!They are mostly about sex, sensuality, and the like.Yuck. I bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like Pride & Prejudice and Emma, etc...These are NOT the same. I threw the set away without even opening it. The ratings are on the back. They should be written on the page.
__label__2 Great card, better than expedcted...: Considering the price of this card, its hard to be disappointed. I installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of Windows XP. As I write this, I am watching an old episode of Star Trek TNG on a small screen on top of AOL. The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system. This card costs about the same as a prime 3D gaming card. It provides dramatic capabilities. ATI has really done a great job with this card. For the price....it cannot be beat.
__label__2 Great card but difficult to setup: As the other reviews noted, there are problems with installing this card, even though I got it working successfully in the end. Although it isn't my top pick for a graphics card, I have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my VCR and print my digital videos to VHS (yes, this is possible, although it is a bit tricky to setup.)I withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup. If the user manual would have been more comprehensive, and if the ATI website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card, the whole nasty ordeal of card setup (that almost all night) might have been spared.
__label__1 same: Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. "12th rising", "brimstone gate", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can't really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren't capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra.
__label__2 Louie's Goose: A good childrens' book, excellent for reading to pre-school aged children. The text can easily be understood by the 3 and 4 year olds in my library story hour as they identify with Louie and his most favorite stuffed animal, a red goose. The illustrations are great!
__label__1 Trite story line with poor recipes: I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite, even contrived. THe "culinary" part of the mystery included recipes that, while tasty, are hardly gourmet -- they mostly consisted of things made with Campbell's soup. Not one that I recall was indigenous to Mexico. At least it was a quick read.
__label__1 an unusual writing technique: Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, "Ulysses," did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, "Finnegan's Wake," got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.
__label__1 self indulgent tripe: "What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth"If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel, no one would ever read it. If they did, they would correctly assume that I am, in fact, a pompous erudite fool. And by the way, I know that there are a million academics rating this book that will come on here and tell me how completely wrong my point of view is. But guess what?--I don't care and I'll never actually read any of your responses. Save it for your poor students and old, bearded friends wearing tweed jackets with elbow patches.To the rest of you (normal people)--stay away from this book.
__label__1 My farts make more sense than Finnegans Wake: ye make a book, alas, how is life? Green Bay Packers. Sandwich? Baby. Eat the, President, lake.Like that prose? That is James Joyce. The king of gibberish. I made it up. But when he does it, it is a classic. When I do gibberish, it is not. Why?What the hell is going on with Finnegans Wake??? I don't know.Joyce must be the genious of gibberish.I don't get it.
__label__1 Naked Emperors: Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such "intellectuals" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip.
__label__1 Mad with Vanity: That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW, and the judgment is apt. The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement.
__label__1 He's challenging us to doodle...: I give this book two stars because it's the first, and last, book to tell us what we already should know...that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep. Finningan's Wake reminds me of the canvas I've seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don't we? Joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass. If you think it's worthwhile (personally, I don't) do it. You could be the next James Joyce.
__label__2 Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!: Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity, he is fed up with christians, and the people who distort christianity. Nietzsche is not the antichrist, he is simply the Messenger in a greek tragedy. We are the antichrist."In reality there has been ofnly one christian, and he died on the cross. The Evangel died on the cross. what was called 'Evangel' from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived"antichrist 39Five stars for Nietzsche, three for the lack of notes. Also, there are many times when Nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation.ps I'm older than twelve.
__label__2 Pocket chart: It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
__label__2 Sraight-up raw emotions...: From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw, true emotion - it makes me aware of where I am with myself as well as with others. Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back. I would love to thank the band personally for creating and SHARING thier sound with others...and for inspiring me.
__label__1 I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.: It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack.
__label__2 Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.: Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics, strong music, and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to, buy this and never stop listening to it.
__label__1 Worse than "The Quest": The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement.
__label__2 I liked it, but my dog doesn't.: I had bought one of these for my old dog (a large German Shorthaired Pointer) who had a horrible pulling problem. And it worked perfectly for him, and he didn't seem to mind. On the other hand I just bought one of these for my 10 month old Coonhound, and it also worked to stop his pulling. But he hates it! I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times. I think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up, but now I have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him. Other than that amazing product in it's self.
__label__1 Imitation Brand: They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti, and it cut my dog's face! I tried contacting them, but no response.
__label__1 Not good for small dogs like lhasas: This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won't hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won't work.
__label__2 The Wild Thornberry's Movie: This game is so cool. I have only played it once, and already I would like to purchase it. It has coloring, puzzling, and even adventures. The only time that I ave played was when I was going to a DNA lab, and I had my GBA, with a not-so-fun game, so somebody let me play The Wild Thornberry's Movie Game, and now I would like to purchase it, once again to say that.
__label__1 Disappointed: I am sure the story is fine, but the disk is imperfect, lost my packing slip and need to call to return it.
__label__1 stargate continuum: the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
__label__2 stargat continuam review by cvf: movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough
__label__2 Very pleased!: As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors, writers and producers/director for a job well done!It still takes some getting used to a 'feature-length movie' vs 'made for television'; meaning I was so used to them getting right to it, that I had to learn how to sit back, relax and let the actors take me there.I can only say that I was very satisfied with this purchase and I have a little bit more of Stargate in my home...where it belongs.Thanks!DarrylCincinnati, OH
__label__2 2/3 done: I am pretty happy with installment 2 out of the 3 that were promised. I have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars, but I have a ways to go yet, and so do they! I am anxiously awaiting the next one.
__label__2 It's great to have SGC Back: I hope we'll see more of this mini movies, though it seems for a story like that, a 4 hours movie could have been better. Yet, it's a fantastic storyline, exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on.
__label__2 Above expectation: The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
__label__2 Video Review: Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews, search "MikePetel" on Youtube. Enjoy!
__label__1 Great movie butt o grainy on blueray: I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
__label__1 one time cooker: This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
__label__1 The few standout tracks on this album are...: 1) The intro, "soulstar."2) "youloveme," which should have been the first single, not "forthenight."3) Somewhere between "momentinlife" and "thereason."Otherwise, a less than stellar album.
__label__1 Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!: I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn't even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!
__label__2 This cd is really cool..give him a break: I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild, don't get me wrong all the songs aren't hits BUT for the most part he is doing his thing on this album. Cut my man a break, he is trying and I look forward to his new album. I love his voice, his music and him in general. The tracks that are my fav's are:InfatueightiesWhoknowsFortheNightYouknowyoulovemeMomentinlifeWomanopolyBuy, borrow(from a friend or Library) this Cd it's mellow like the way Neo-soul is supposed to be.Toodles,
__label__2 Jusbeautiful: At first I didn't really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can't wait for the next one.
__label__1 ultimately ineffective: This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn't talented enough to pull off what she's set out to do. Sad, since I was looking forward to reading this, based on the jacket copy. Oh well. This reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read.
__label__2 Run Lola Run: This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so, you will not be disapointed.
__label__2 What if!: This IS your bag:If you like action, fun, stunts, thrillIf you want to see something completely uniqueIf you are not afraid of timeblendsIf you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people (that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery old)If you like cartoonsIf you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletIf you like to experience sheer SPEEDSo, what are you waiting for? Run to get it!One funny sidenote: The movie's rating was for 12 years in germany. Americans are really funny with their prudery. It seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence.
__label__2 My favorite movie ever: this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work...all out A++++movie...everyone should have it!
__label__1 A bit overrated. . .: Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the "alternate-scenario" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me.
__label__2 Achtung!: This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over, it just takes you on another turn and another and another!!! If you like fast paced, unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove, this one's for you.
__label__2 Good for Hip and Knee joints in my Bichons: This product is palatable and seems to work well with my Bichon, who injured her knee in a tussle with my younger Bichon. The joint works well and she seems to not have anymore pain. I recommend this product.
__label__2 RELLY CHALINGING.: RELLY QUICK action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern.batell is a chalinging game you fite. you can race to.
__label__1 Just another excuse to make money: I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back.
__label__2 10 stars!: This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it'll be the best album you buy all year!
__label__1 Disappointing: This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice, the description of it is a bit overblown.The tea inside was okay. Some of the combinations of flavors just didn't go well together, and often drowned the flavor of the tea.
__label__2 Thank goodness for Amazon!: My cable was out, and I missed my favorite shows. Thank goodness for Amazon where I could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee. Thanks!
__label__2 Joshua & Children: This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders.
__label__2 Nice CD, but mislabelled: This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It's a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]
__label__2 Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique: I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn't deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. "What's is a Componium, Part 1" goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it "Charles's Birthday Card" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, "Will You Gamelan For Me?" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on "What's is a Componium, Part 2," a track that sparkles like moondust. "Calypso in a Box" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, "I'll Read You a Story," which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere.
__label__2 McDuffie's elegance and artistry are marvelous.: I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie's playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase "spun silver," though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie's discs, and I hope others will, too.
__label__2 Great value, brute force: First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be "cheating drivers"Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues
__label__1 Not a horror movie, a horrible movie: This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.
__label__1 Absolute Crap!: Okay, if you're a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you're a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I've ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN'T show you. The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the '63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!
__label__1 A Truley Horrible Horror Film: A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special "special effects" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it.
__label__1 Too awful to be funny: I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare
__label__1 Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!: Is "The House On Haunted Hill" so different than "The Haunting"? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors, good story but not well told with its poor suspense! The old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful!!!
__label__2 Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick: If you like super-natural mysteries, then you'd like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.
__label__1 ...and what a feeble haunting it is!: No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a "horror" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into "stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)
__label__1 Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS, what a waste!: Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson's lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies' set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you've been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a "horror" movie isn't believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!
__label__1 Poor plot: The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite.
__label__1 Catherine Zeta-Hipboots: A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. ("I've got the save the children!" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film.
__label__1 Typical Hollywood pulp: Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me.
__label__1 EMBARASSINGLY BAD: This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!
__label__1 IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT: "The Haunting" with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don't they remake "The Wizard Of Oz?" Now, there's a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what's still is a great universal story.
__label__1 Sadly Disappointing: This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare.
__label__1 It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...: This 1999 horror film based on the original "The Haunting", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get "The Blair Witch Project".
__label__1 Poor re-make of a good movie: I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn't spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson's wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older 'Haunting.' You'll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn't necessarily mean better.
__label__2 A lot better than the factory seat.: The seat was a cinch to install. It took about 10 minutes tops, and it's a lot more comfortable than the factory seat the bike came with.
__label__2 Great story: I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago. I was so happy to have it to download and read again on my Kindle!
__label__2 Please the parents and the kids: Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart, our 15-month old perks up when ralph is on, and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics - even though we hear this music daily ! The music is rich and doesn't go stale, and manages to bridge the generation gap.
__label__1 too small for a newborn: I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
__label__2 book review: Book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it. Great that it comes with a CD.
__label__2 A great buy: This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!
__label__2 helped a bit: studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab, so it helped me to study harder versions. passed with a score of 94.
__label__2 A Surprising Find: The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an "American music" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review, search "American Indianists" and Fred Flaxman.
__label__2 5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd: While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, "accidental" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.
__label__2 Make sure you see Jean de Florette first: This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.
__label__1 Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam: I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC, but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam. I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one, but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card, so I hope this might help some potential buyers...
__label__1 Will Die, Don't Buy: It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache.
__label__2 My favorite book of all-time: I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me, reading them in a bookstore in Albuquerque. Inventive, humane, human, magical.
__label__2 Simply Superb.: I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical, creating the world of the Buendias inside of me. Someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream. I agree.
__label__2 This Book Changed My Life: Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing. I personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through. I couldn't put it down, it simple spoke to me. Rules to follow while reading this: 1.) Pay attention and savor, and 2.) Open your mind
__label__2 Macondo, la capital del mundo: Gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en Macondo. Olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado, este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo, amor, odio, guerras. Y los Buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta. Esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron, no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final. Al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de Macondo dentro de nosotros.
__label__1 Too Boring to Continue: I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It's a dry description of their adventures and I'm left with a "so what?" Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold.
__label__1 Columbian family values: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions.
__label__1 500 pages of boredom: The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.
__label__2 my #1 book: this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot
__label__1 You must read this book!: This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
__label__1 Emporer's new clothes.: I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don't mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who's educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed.
__label__2 U will never read anything like it: I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have.
__label__2 One of the best ever.....: I have read this book 4 times, and I can read it 100 times more, and never get tired of it. This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.
__label__2 A Haunting and Incredible Experience: I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish, but I decided to try the English translation. I was overwhelmed. For days I was in a trance. I could not and did not want to pull myself away from Macondo and the Buendia family. The words hypnotized me. The scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.
__label__1 lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself "Wow! This seems like a great story!" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....
__label__1 Could never read this book....: This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving.
__label__2 Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece: This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries."Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!
__label__2 great card: This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great, it's DirectX supported (a biggie) and is far superior to most cards of the same price. The reviewer who says it doesn't work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card. If he bought the AGP card, maybe he should try the PCI. Anyway, this is a great video card from a great company for a great price. BUY IT!
__label__2 The best discworld novel; for beginners or veterans: I've read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)
__label__2 Pratchett I just love him: the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories, obviousl;y fantasy but so real. And if you love word play you will never find better
__label__1 I'll second that: I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs.
__label__2 Carrot, Vimes, Colon and Nobbs are all back to fight crime!: Carrot, Vimes, Colon, Nobbs are back. With also alot of new recruits:Angua, Detritus and Cuddy. What is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs, clowns and assasins? Is Vimes finally going to get married? Who knows?
__label__1 Terrible product, did not work, and company unreachable.: I purchased this item for my son, and it did not work right out of the box. I followed all the terrible instructions, and it still did not work. I went to the Coby website for answers, and there was nothing there either. I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone, and was never able to get through. I finally returned the product for a different bran. I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life. and MUCH better support and documentation.
__label__2 Where are the other seasons?: This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date, but I can't seem to get a difinitive answer. This has been out for almost 2 years. Please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released. I'll sign a petition if that will help!!!L.W.
__label__1 Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable: I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ...
__label__1 Beware of editions by General Books LLC: Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material, but without any editing.There are so many errors though that the result may be unusable.Usability probably depends on subject matter, but the many OCR-errors make even prose an annoying read.Especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled.See the review of J.M. Keynes' "A treatise on probability" on this site which I bought but is useless, and similar comments by other buyers (on "Vanity Fair" by Thackeray; on "The Italian" by Radcliffe)
__label__1 Kindle version is very poorly edited: The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one 'page' after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn't work at all.
__label__1 Aaarrrggghhh: Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online. Regardless, it is a classic and, I suspect, not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it.
__label__2 Cnnterbury Tales(Oxford Word's Classics): This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure. I found the stories to be earthy, funny, but sometimes sad.
__label__1 Great movie, poor audio transfer: It is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on DVD that the audio would be out of synch. Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings?
__label__1 Tedious and Self-Inflating: I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS.
__label__2 This is GOLD!: Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order
__label__2 Excellent fiddle: I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes, which fit together well as a whole. I think I listened to it about 6 times in a row when I first got it.
__label__1 This Coyote Is No Genius: The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you'd expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as "Dad"...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.The bar scenes have a certain energy to 'em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).Here's hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career.
__label__2 Good movie + these Coyotes aren't ugly!: This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the "unrated version." In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It's definitely a cutesy movie, but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching. Piper Perabo and the rest of the girls won't disappoint I promise!
__label__1 The bar scenes were cool, but that's about it: I bought this movie because I love Jerry Bruckheimer movies. I should have just rented it. The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer. That about sums up the good scenes. When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it! Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling! I'm one of those people who like all kinds of movies, even some really bad ones, but this is one that I don't think I will be watching again.
__label__1 Coyote Stupid: This movie is so dumb... "HOW DUMB IS IT?" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb, Dumb, DUMB.Did I mention that it stunk too.
__label__1 Absolutely horrible!: This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with "The Whole Nine Yards" and "Cruel Intentions"). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!
__label__2 Great Movie: I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie
__label__2 Stunning: I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God's hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson's rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd, which was just as good, but in a different way. That is what makes this a great band (among other things). THe ability to reinvent without loosing the soul/sound of the music.Two great albums. I can only hope that they grace us all with many more.
__label__2 A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.: this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting, it my advice is to go buy it. go spend a measly 15 bucks to get it, its well worth the money.
__label__2 Rocks. Best. Get it.: Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.
__label__2 GREAT: Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
__label__2 the album grows on me...: I bought Garbage's first album first and I thought the album was great, boasting good tracks like Milk, Queer, Only Happy When it Rains, but the sophomore album was even better. 'Temptation Waits' started out with Manson's menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like, "I tell you something, I am a wolf but, I like to wear sheep's clothing." The second track had a rockier edge to it, and then slowed down with 'Medication'. And then it was fun all the way till "You Look So Fine" which ended the album with a sombre note, like how Garbage ended its first title with "Milk."A great buy, almost perfection - you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest.
__label__2 Shirley...yum: Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track "Temptation Waits" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track "I Think I'm Paranoid" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for, love the lyrics too.A great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru Garbage. A word of advice though...don't bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan...defienatley not impressive.
__label__2 Shirley & The Boys Do It Again: Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998's "Version 2.0". Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards & effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin' tracks as "Temptation Waits," "I Think I'm Paranoid," "Push It," and my personal fave, "Sleep Together." There's also playful pop-rock with "Special" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious "Hammering In My Head," and the truly gorgeous "You Look So Fine." Fabulous music & production from a fabulous band, "Version 2.0" is essential Garbage.
__label__2 Great show: Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show, one of my fav shows
__label__2 GREAT: AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW, WHAT SERVICE....MY GRAND-DAUGHTER ALSO THANKS YOU!!!
__label__2 absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie: Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.
__label__2 Julia: If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching,sad,and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we'd go in the name of friendship.
__label__2 Review of JULIA: DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...
__label__1 Glich Heaven: I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one
__label__2 Wonderful flow: What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!
__label__1 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !: There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer, there is no special "surf yoga" as opposed to "regular" yoga. Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit. Peggy's videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury. It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a "yoga matrix" which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.
__label__1 Another Bogus "How to be a better surfer DVD.": This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the "instructor" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video.
__label__1 dont do it: If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw's Video for a great intermediate yoga tape.
__label__1 no book key: I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn't have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn't leave the book as I requested by signing the "LEAVE PACKAGE" form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I'm never at home.
__label__1 Needs some modification: This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place.
__label__2 Nigerians! An Industrious People: When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children, ages 5 years and up, to give them a glimpse of Nigeria, its people and culture. I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are.
__label__1 If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!!: My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs.
__label__2 Nice Experience.: This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one.
__label__2 A rebuttal ...: ... to Jazzie of Hampstead, London. Don't know what you were looking at. Your last graf, where you make up some quote from Lou at the end of the show, is totally bogus. In fact, Lou says just the opposite. Pay no attention to that innacurate review. Lou has his good nights and his bad nights. This was one of the best performances of his career.
__label__2 Native American Herbal Remedies: So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to "flip through the book" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.
__label__1 blleeuurrgghhhh: i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none.
__label__2 Dad is in Trouble: This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.
__label__2 can't stand those male co-stars: I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!
__label__1 bad acting: This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It's a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.
__label__2 Switching Goals - a very good movie: Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it.
__label__1 Entertaining, but freaky: My son wanted this video so we got it. There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL. Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.
__label__1 Will bore you to death: Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
__label__2 A good book: I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.
__label__1 Not happy: I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
__label__2 Nice suit.: It is a great suit, great buy, great service all around! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these.
__label__1 Worst test prep book I have ever used.: As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time.
__label__1 preliminary review: I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book, but in the first 15 pages I have already found four seriously misleading errors (and that's just the ones I've caught!). Some of the equations (even the Henderson-Hasselbalch) they provide are wrong. There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation. You can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the GRE, but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.
__label__2 Wild Wild West: This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
__label__1 Isn't there a larger version of this game??: This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn't survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.
__label__1 Disappointed: My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.
__label__1 It's great when it works: I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money.
__label__2 the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert: yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I'm only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!
__label__2 Goodfun: Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or "No! You go on without me ...". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O'Reilly's authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn't that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler's Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it. That's just the kind of book it is.
__label__1 Borinmg & dumb: A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world, and they don't.Don't bother, a nice tape to record over.And the last time I buy a film because Brandon Frazier is in it. Naked or not!
__label__2 Best film of the year: One of the best films ever made, Gods and Monsters works on many levels. It presents the many roles men play -- gay/straight, husband/bachelor, parent/child, lover/monster, youth/elderly, whitecollar/bluecollar -- wrapped in a captivating story. Listen for the music; it's hauntingly beautiful.
__label__2 See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!: "Gods and Monsters" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie.
__label__2 best screenplays have more stability: One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that.
__label__1 Tree arrived bent and poorly packed: The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. I have no idea how this tree looked all put together since I had to repack it and send it back. Thankfully Amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! In the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . I may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again.
__label__2 A Legendary story by Robert Creamer: Of the 200+ baseball books I've read, "Babe: The Legend Comes to Life" is my favorite. Creamer wrote the book while some of the old-timers were still alive, and this makes his story come to life. If you want to learn about Babe Ruth, this is the definitive book to read.
__label__2 A Great Book on a Sports Legend: This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall, we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong 20's into the 30's.My only issue was that I didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death. I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan.
__label__2 This will make your install a breeze. . .: My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
__label__2 Great summer read: This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer, and overall, I enjoyed it. The plot brings three just-turned-thirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the 50-something mother of their recently deceased friend. Wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters, their various flaws notwithstanding. She also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much. The strongest character is the Mother, Natalie, who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction, and by no means a mere caricature. My only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones. But in fairness to Wolitzer, in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters, and it's only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all.
__label__2 Gripping Novel About the Loss of a Child: The novel is a wrenching page-turner about a woman's loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live. The author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman's friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved. It is the best book I have read all year!
__label__1 If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have!: I looked forward to reading yet another Meg Wolitzer novel, and I was very disappointed--in fact, I lost interest early on and never finished it. Some of the author's earlier works, such as Sleepwalking and Hidden Pictures, were excellent--what happened???
__label__2 Helpful Start: Good book to start with; motivated me to get more books to read more about the nuances and subtleties about the game.
__label__1 Sooo dissapointed: I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future, and you're allowed to use a medical dictionary, and I picked this one.I've been taking practice tests. On the first practice test I took, the first 6 out of 7 medical terms I tried to look up weren't in the book. I was stunned, and several of them were pretty basic words that I just wanted to get a very clear definition of.I'm not sure it's even going to be worth lugging this book to the test, or even keeping the book. I may just sell it and try another book.Jane
__label__1 Material too flimsy: I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig, chew or abuse things in any way, so I wasn't concerned with getting a super abuse-proof bed. But after a couple of weeks of limited use I found a hole in the soft side of the bed. The fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate, but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying. It may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials. Very disappointing.
__label__1 Disappointed: I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However, other purchases in the past have been great through Amazon.
__label__1 Looks & feels like a bootleg product.: My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby, much less DTS, only a PCM Stereo recording. Video is average. Like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought.All in all, this looks like a bootleg edition. And no, it's an official release. Amazing. Messy. What were they thinking?
__label__2 Underappreciated Effort: While even some members of the Bonzos give this album low marks, I personally think Keynsham holds up very well. Without it we wouldn't have "You Done My Brain In," "Mr. Slater's Parrot," the definitive "Look At Me I'm Wonderful," "Quiet Talks and Summer Walks" or "Sport (the Odd Boy)," which would be a damn shame no matter how you slice it. While this did prove to be the end of the line (Let's Make Up and Be Friendly notwithstanding), there still seemed to be a lot of gas left in the tank.
__label__2 Awesome!: I Love this. My kids have so much fun with these. They are strong and hold up to ruff play. They shoot water clear accross the pool.
__label__1 A look at a distant past: I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems, how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in Medieval Spain
__label__2 Excellent Translation!: If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the "Good News" and the ORIGINAL "Revised Standard." I have respect for the "King James," the "New King James," the "Jerusalem," the "English Standard Version," and the "Holman Christian Standard." I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the "Revised Standard" and the "New King James." My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the "Revised Standard." But that said, the "New American Standard" is excellent.
__label__2 One of Clftons great ones: I love all of Clifton Webb films, this one really extracts his serious side of acting. great film of the era, he is truly the one of the best actors of his time.
__label__1 PURE JUNK: SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER, EVERY SINGLE TIME
__label__1 Poor example. The homework problems like hell: The examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems. Never explain how to do bode plot at all. I am glad I know how to do differential equations before taking the class, otherwise, to use the method that taught by this book, I would be dead. They never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind.
__label__1 Misleading title: A book with a heavily religious slant. Anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that "God has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires".
__label__1 Propaganda: As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health, I am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book. For those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace, please do not invest in this propaganda. This book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering. This type of hate mongering, intolerant, uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history's most devastating atrocities, done in the name of "God." A basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients. Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor. You are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering.
__label__2 Excellent information: This book was suggested to me by a counselor I was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction. We both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction. There is so much information in this book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
__label__1 Great Concert - Bad DVD: I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
__label__2 Great deal on a fine subwoofer: I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room, and because the DD-15 was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the DD-15 Plus (at considerably higher price).The DD-15 is cruising in our new house. It really provides the bottom end that my Klipsch Heresies cannot. And it does not run out of steam at high volume, like the FSR-12 did.I am mainly a music guy, not so much into home theatre. The DD-15 brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you. Everything you need is included, and the calibration software is a snap to use. The cabinetry is first rate. I got the cherry finish, and although I can't tell if it is really cherry; I would not bet money against it. It looks that good.I am quite pleased with Velodyne as a company, and I love my DD-15.
__label__1 This Book is NOT for NXT: It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated, you'd be better off to find a good book which is based on the NXT system.
__label__2 Practical Guide When Making This Challenging Decision: No one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there! This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere, simple, and complete. This is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move. The one knock I would make on the book is that sometimes it is not time to move and the book says very little about when to stay where you are. More detail should be given to the decision making process.
__label__2 Excelente: Tego es la fuerza en la musica latina. Es una tremenda mezcla de son, salsa, reggaeton y hip-hop. Que estupendo!!!!!!!
__label__2 definitely the best horror\suspense book I know: Since you open the book you cannot close it,you have to go through, to dive in the horror, in the thrill, in the lush. Stephen King fans, please find "Disturb not the dream" by Paula Trachtman and read it once, read it twice then give it to your friends, this is the real thing, it is a must.
__label__2 why?: This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening, strident tone with an attack that is relentless; he takes his time building momentum and surprises with twists and turns but never loses his footing. When you play this recording it is difficult to do anything else but listen; it is that captivating.Lou Grassi and Wilbur Morris don't just sit in the back seat for this ride. They compliment the leader and provide idiomatic support all the way through.It is an amazing ride and one that I will continue returning to. Rob Brown is one of a small handful of players who always provides the goods. All of his efforts are worth investigating. If you can find this one, it's a real jewel.
__label__2 chuck: This a good movie in the same vain as most of Chuck Norris's films, plenty of action, a must have for your collection.
__label__2 Memory Lane: I saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the 70's and I recommended it to my daughter. When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player), I explored the option of reading the book. I was intrigued when I realized that the book was written in the 60's - a bit of a cultural leap from the 70's, when the movie was produced - so I decided to give it a read. Although I didn't grow up in the priveleged classes of Manhattan, I was a teenager throughout the 60's and I could relate to the times. It seemed a little milder in some respects from what I remember of the movie (and my memory is not the greatest), but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.
__label__2 Love these little smoker bisquettes.: I love the Bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses. It is so easy to use. We've used the mesquite and pork and chicken. It's all turned out great.
__label__2 the best kept secret anti aging creams on the planet: Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.
__label__1 Doesn't fit my situation.: My fault. I received it OK but it just doesn't work on my water heater. I must not have checked it enough. It was a bad impulse buy for me.
__label__2 One of the Best Romances I have Read: This is the first book from Candice Porter I have read and I cannot wait to begin reading her other novels. From the minute I read the first page, I knew that this book would be original and hard to put down. The characters are believable and Ms. Proctor's writing is so detailed that you feel you are there with them throughout the book. I would definitely recommend this book - you will not be sorry that you bought it!
__label__2 Underrated album: I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others, but I took a chance on it, and I give it 4 stars. "Put It Where You Want It" is excellent, both in track one and the jamming version on track 11, and "Roll With It" is also excellent. There's no question that it's hard to beat some of Larry's finest songs. My personal favorite is "Smiles and Smiles to Go" and it's hard to beat his old album "Discovery". But if you're a Larry Carlton fan, I think 4 stars is about right for this one.
__label__2 lo mejor del cine español: esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone
__label__1 Well made but extremely skewed: This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them, that's human nature, but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts. After watching this program, an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the American program was morally, intellectually and patriotically inferior to their Russian counterparts.Viewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis.
__label__2 Well worth watching: The Space Race wasn't quite as one sided as one might believe. This series outlines the benefits of Capitalism over Communism but also shows serious flaws in NASA work to "get man to the moon before this decade is out".
__label__1 Not one of Rinaldi's "masterpiecies", yet not so bad: Well, to be really honest with you, I didn't like this book. Personally, I though Ann Rinaldi could've done a little better. Some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful, but the rest is kind of dull. At some points in the book, Emily, the main character, is lying so much to her Uncle Valentine and is being so selfish, it's like, "okay, so when's she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done?"
__label__1 This was not one of her best books, yet not a failure.: This book is really exciting;from the first chapter only. I am going to be honest with you, because if I raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was, it would be a lie. It was written with appropreate remarks and English grammer, but sometimes storys just don't get you in the heart. This perticular one didn't. But there are her other books, which I would say, are a masterpiece!
__label__2 An Aquaintance With Darkness: This book was an absolute joy to read. It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring. This book is what I call a "people-y" book. She forms the characters so that they seem like real people, with real problems.
__label__2 Excellent!: This was the first book I had read by Ann Rinaldi and I loved it! I have read many other books by her since then. At first I thought I would not like this book because it takes place over 100 years ago, but I was wrong. Rinaldi draws you into the book. The main character, Emily, is very likable. She's not perfect. She has some flaws, like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friend's mother is arrested and may be put to death. The novel is also very historically accurate. Before I never knew grave robbing had been a problem in the 1800's. I highly reccomend this book
__label__1 A story based on a song: As soon as I had read the first few sentences of the review I immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by Loreena McKennitt called "The Highway Man", from her 1997 CD "Book of Secrets". Since Ms. McKennitt is on of my favorite composers I had to read the book.Unfortunately the book did not do justice to the song or the woman who wrote the song. Did the author have permission to write this. I'm sorry but listening to the song is preferable.
__label__1 Well, we couldn't get Yoko Kanno, so here's Yoko Ono instead: What can I say? This CD is pretty much everything the other Cowboy Bebop CD's aren't. It's pretty much either 1) Take a perfectly good track and ruin it by throwing a lot of drums on top (Vibert) or 2) as far as I can tell, calling a mediocre lifeless piece of electronic pap by the same name as a totally dissimilar but good track off another CD (4 Hero). Either way, the originals far outshine any of the pointless meddling done on this CD.On the does/doesn't include Vitaminless topic, I got this album by mistake. I ordered Vitaminless but what I got was a double CD of this and Vitaminless. I can't imagine a more mistaken pairing.
__label__2 Hawaii in a bottle: I love this stuff! I first bought in Hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful. So I bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when I cant be there in person!
__label__2 Kinuko San is back?: I have not heard this album, but for those of you who remember the ORIGINAL Priss from the BubbleGum Crisis, Hurricane should be on here! if not than it is not her best!
__label__2 Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.: My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class.
__label__2 Do your homework: This product works great, BUT you will need a different driver (see Ralink website for it). I run both Xp Pro and XP 64 bit and I had some problems. This product did not work the same with both versions of XP without the driver from Ralink, included software had problems with my Netgear router. (speed was not fast or consistent.)
__label__1 Una porqueria no compre: Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse, veo todas las redes pero no puede conectarse. lo barato sale caro
__label__2 Math made easy: This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
__label__1 Average Book: The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
__label__1 Some one has an EGO problem.: I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book. And I was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me, Michael G from Passaic NJ, said that I was mistaken for my previous diatribe of the book. I'm not sure who it was. Obviously someone figured that I was not going to read the reviews again. I'm not sure who it was.I still maintain that the beek is BAD. It seems that some one is trying to sell this at all costs. This makes me very suspicious of all Amazon reviews. Sorry :(MG
__label__2 Legend or the truth?: The Hound of the Baskervilles is a true mystery classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty comrade, Dr. John Watson. This extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before, but now come to their most difficult case. Years ago, Hugo Baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound. This curse of the hound has haunted all the Baskervilles who come to live at the Baskerville Hall. Sir Charles goes to live there, but soon is found dead, scared to death. His only relative, Sir Henry Baskerville, goes to live at Baskerville Hall accompanied by Holmes and Watson. All along the way, they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer. I really liked this classic who-dun-it because around every corner was a twist. It kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat.
__label__1 for this particular edition: Seeing as how Series 2 of "Sherlock" has yet to make it to the United States, I was hoping that this would be the script, or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format. Sadly, this was not the case.I confess that I fail to see how this series (of BBC Books) distinguishes itself from the other (often free) editions, much less the compilations, available in the Kindle store. There is a new introduction by a member of the BBC's "Sherlock" staff and company, but that scarcely justifies the cost.The text itself is the standard text by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle which speaks for itself.
__label__2 A Sherlock Holmes Story Starring...Dr. WATSON!: Well, you don't get much of Holmes in this story, and many folks either neglect to mention that or just don't notice. I figure they don't notice because it's such a darn good read. At first, it's TALK, TALK, TALK. But the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and I became engrossed. Read it!
__label__1 Don't waste your time on this edition!: As other reviewers have pointed out, this particular Kindle version is broken: any passages in the original which appeared in italic type have failed to be transcribed, leaving large gaps in the narrative, especially at the beginning.Therefore I rate this edition one star.
__label__1 MISSING TEXT!!!!!!: This review is NOT on the quality of the story. I love this book, however.... This edition is missing text. Whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document, the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this Kindle edition! I've no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text, but its frustating as this was my first download.
__label__1 Plastic limitations: When I got the product and opened the box, the literature said that you cannot use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow. This is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filter.That's the kind of shower head I have, and I like to use the valve feature. I really really wish that eGeneralMedical had said this in their (limited) online literature. And they expect me to pay the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee!
__label__2 Great John Wayne Movie, YOOOOOOOOOOOOO!: Its a strange size for my TV, but, its a 1948 movie, so its exceptional! I have wanted this movie for years so I bought it!
__label__1 Disappointing: I got this video on loan from Netflix. As a railfan, I was extremely disappointed in this. The show was nothing like I had anticipated it being like. And the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate Emeril Lagasse
__label__2 My 5 year old is obsessed!!!!!: Great video. My son cant get enough of this. Any child or adult who loves trains will enjoy this DVD,
__label__2 Rad! Or as they say in Dutch, heel goed!: I love Holland and the Dutch language, and my Dutch penpal sent me a tape with various Dutch artists. I love "Dromen Zijn Bedrog", which is a mix of sort of modern-90s music, techno, and a chorus in the background. Fast and energetic! I don't recall the other songs too well but this album is awesome. Go Dutch!
__label__2 One of the most AWESOME books I've ever read !: John Bunyan's, "Pilgrim's Progress"has to be one of the most captivating books ever written. This book should be "required reading" in today's school system. From the verybeginning Mr.Bunyan spins the tale of a journey that is most fantastic! Thur perils unbeliveable he somehow overcomes tremendous odds ofcompleting it. But yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent. A MUSTFOR ANYONE BORN AGAIN!!!!!
__label__2 practical guide to modern christian living: in this book, buyan writes about average everyday things of the 1700s, and about the christian plight of that time. i found it remarkable how truth does not change '.'
__label__2 Best Unknown Artist: What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation, which is good, fades into the backround because Christy's voice is so present and distinctive. I can't tell you how many times I've played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock. Its a great album to enjoy when you're happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when you're with someone special. I'm so glad I found some other music by her and I surely hope there is more comming. By the way, it has a couple of cuts that don't feature her and they are interesting and don't detract from the album. Also, I read in one of her bios that she starred in an indie movie called Pants on Fire. You can bet I'll be watching that if I can locate it.
__label__1 Not as good as the other album!: I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However, I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you. I was expecting more of Christy Baron's sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what I got was some sort of a synthesized versions. It's still a good album but it's nothing like the other one. If you can only buy one album of Christy Baron, don't get this one.
__label__1 In a word...: painful. Neither Paltrow nor Beckinsale were perfect either, but this one was appalling.This movie is packaged in 2 cassettes, and I couldn't even make it through the first one. Where do I begin? The hair was awful (especially Mr. Elton's), the casting was awful (Jeremy Northam will always be Mr. Knightley to me), the costumes were awful (zippers, anyone?). I hung in as long as I could to see what they did with Frank Churchill, but I just couldn't go on. So sad...My feeling about a good adaptation is that it should make you want to run out and buy the book. I'm glad I'd already read Emma 4 or 5 times because this movie certainly would not have made me desperate to read the book. I probably would have run screaming in the other direction.I did like their take on Mr. Woodhouse though. Thank Goodness for small favors!
__label__1 No ADA seal of approval: I have this toothpaste and the ADA seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube. It doesn't whiten either.
__label__1 I found this product for $7.99 today...: I found this exact same product for $7.99 today at Walgreens. This is a sale price, however, even regular price is less than this. I feel some/many of the mega diaper packs on amazon are a good deal, but not this one.
__label__1 Holds #1, not #2: The title says it all. I never had a trouble with #1 leaking, but almost everytime my breastfed son has a BM (which are usually somewhat loose), it leaks out the back or leg area. Perhaps it happens because the waistband isn't stretchy. I'm not going to buy these diapers again.
__label__2 cool!: claudia and shea are both in trouble at school. If they fail one more language test, she may not past the sunject. so what they do is to help each other and that's where they become friends.
__label__2 Marlon Brando: A good, but slow performance by Brando. The girl should be in future films. Mature Only.
__label__1 Horrible!: Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of "off the edge" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought "Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least.
__label__2 Well made, but depressing.: This is another "artistic" movie. The acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of Marlon Brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the one-hit-wonder girl that starred with him is valid. It was worth watching, but probably not worth owning. It's ultimately very depressing and doesn't really leave you holding on to anything. The sex scenes were pretty explicit, but not really anything you couldn't see in a 'hard-R' movie today. Buy it for the acting, not the story.
__label__1 Useless: The DVD will not play. It goes thru the process of downloading until the last point & then says that it is not programed for downloading. I would like to send it back for a DVD that will play.
__label__2 Another great book in the series: I really love this book just as much as the two before it. I just don't want the series to end because I'm enjoying it so much.
__label__2 The single creepiest film of the year !!!: At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated, let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first Alien film. Writer/Director Neil Marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that, for once, doesn't rely on all the hacneyed tricks and CGI effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can't act to save their lives. This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably. The score by David Julyan is the perfect accompaniment to Marshall's film and the cinematography and editing by Sam McCurdy and Jon Harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films.I normally don't purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me I just had to own a copy. I would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels.
__label__1 VERY BAD MOVIE: This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk, with no "flight plan" filed with anyone. Then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous. With friends like that.....Then of course, in the cave, blind monsters (people in rubber suits) show up to murder all the women.First of all, why would such strong, fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing, screaming, and hysterical stereotypes.Secondly, the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suits.Steer clear of this movie. It is horrible. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers.
__label__1 Awful Waste of Money!: This tape should be sold as an audio only. The cave scenes are so dark, it is pointless to watch; the direction is poor; character development doesn't exist. It is too bad the rating system does not have a choice of zero or negative stars.
__label__1 movie was a waste of money: this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it, the movie sucked dont buy it.
__label__1 trash, i wish I could give it no stars!!!!!!: I love horror movies!!! But this is really a horrible movie, the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used. The actresses were very bad at acting, and not in that cool b-horror movie way either, they suck. I know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trash,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS ONLY 90 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!Guess I will start having to go back to the Asian import shop for good horror.
__label__1 over rated: had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!
__label__2 This book is great!: I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.
__label__2 Presto, chango, Magic is fun...WE'RE DEAD!: I saw this when I was 12 years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me - low on gore, high on psychological thrils, MAGIC is an old-school horror flick of the classic kind - anchored by Anthony Hopkin's early bravura dual performance as Corky/Fats - but what I remember most about MAGIC isn't the movie, but the scary as hell TV spots that used to run back in the 70s on late-night TV - the bonus materials explain that after the simple, yet very creepy TV ads ran ONCE on TV in New York, they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots - they're weren't far of the mark - as the camera pulls in and "Fats" intones his evil poem - "Magic is fun...we're...DEAD!" - you'll feel your blood turn to ice. A nice DVD to complete your horror collection - [...]
__label__2 Creepy old Anthony Hopkins film: Magic stars Anthony Hopkins long before Silence of the Lambs. His character "Corky" is a magician who can't seem to catch a break. He decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success. His ventriloquist partner "Fats" starts to take over Corky's thoughts and motives. The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me. Just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing. Great movie!
__label__1 harassing bears?: Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: "Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins," by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?
__label__2 THE best book for AP spanish!: This book is the absolute best buy for AP Spanish Language preparation. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam (although I thought that they had a little more then what was needed). The practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test. Having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher, I picked up this book and used it for self-study. It helped me greatly, and in the end, I received a 4 just by going through it myself and practicing.
__label__2 great lil printer, BUT: I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.
__label__2 good printer: I have bought this printer for my personal use at home.It is good and reliable printer for the price.Somehow, it arrived with software instalation CD in a forein language which was a big inconvenience.The white color chose by manufacturer is a questionable. It is a white spot in a room and I bet for many households it can be a problem.Also, lack of any controls buttons is inconvenient to restart a job even after paper reload.
__label__2 A quiet workhorse!: Bought this and just to test if I would keep it, I printed a huge database file of 16,000 pages which took me almost 20 hours between personal breaks and only five cartridges. The guide says don't do that, but I did it, and this 1020 printer did not fail once. Wow! (Needless to say, I kept it!)
__label__1 Great printer, unless you're using Vista: I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable.
__label__1 1020 printer stopped working after few months: I can't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months. I bought it last Dec, but only start to use it 3 months ago. Now it stopped working. Does anybody know this printer has any warranty? Thanks!
__label__2 Excellent Entry Level Laser Printer: If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
__label__2 Great Read - Suspenseful: When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book.
__label__2 classic: hardly ever see this movie on tv..so i had to order..love it a must see!! went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kid...never forgotten it!!
__label__1 WHAT!!!: Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this, then rap is officially dead, and the only thing that can resurrect it is a Bone Thugs reunion.
__label__2 A classic!: Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious', as others have mentioned, but that shouldn't be a problem if you appreciate different styles(?) of reggae. Did I forget to mention 'Super Ape' or Augustus Pablo? Man.
__label__1 Design flaw prevents easy installation: For a 1/2" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2" copper pipes longer than about 1" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort.
__label__2 Love old recipes: thanks for compiling these recipes. They were fun to read, and although I am certain that I am not going to make any of them, it was fun reading them.
__label__1 I want to like this.: The tracks are great.The playing (might be) great.The recording quality is wretched.I hate to say that, but it is that bad.
__label__1 Shame on you, Mr Coffee!: Jeez, I figured you guys KNEW about coffee! This is a terrible excuse for a warmer. It keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature, not nearly warm enough to be pleasant. I bought two of them and am tossing them out. Anyone considering this item? DON'T buy one!!!
__label__2 Great gift: I was given this as a christmas gift, and it's more than lived up to my expectations.It won't heat a cold cup of coffee, but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long time.Works best if you actually drink the coffee, the less coffee in the cup, the more effective it is... A full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm, but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time, the end will still be a good temp.
__label__2 Mr. Coffee Warmer: The warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk. The warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off. I could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
__label__1 Mr Coffee mug warmer: I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
__label__1 Warm, not hot: This is my second coffee warmer. I lost my first one, a no-name cheap model that worked beautifully, so I bought two of the Mr. Coffee version, one for me and one for my spouse. It really won't maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about 1 ounce left. I would not recommend this product. We had the same experience with both Mr. Coffee warmers, so it wasn't a case of a defective item. It just doesn't work.
__label__2 Very nice product: I have been using this product for a few weeks. I have a ceramic tea pot that I use to make a few cups of tea at a time, and the tea was getting cold way too quickly. This product keeps my whole pot of tea nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink -- which has been up to about six hours. I'm getting ready to buy a second one for my tea cup, so my tea stays warm once I pour it from the tea pot.
__label__1 Doesn't keep coffee warm: Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well, barely warm -- but significantly cooler than I'd like. My preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured -- not crazy hot, but more than lukewarm. This isn't even close. And don't even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because you've been carrying it around for a few minutes.
__label__1 Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer: The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm, but my beverage isn't.
__label__2 Good heat, limited space: The warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm. The switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate (as opposed to one on the cord). The one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug. I guess it just holds the standard size.
__label__2 Works pretty well for regular sized mugs: The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks "city" mugs, so note that. But a smaller mug (a.k.a. regular sized or one that doesn't have a wide base) will fit fine. I agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full. I think the product description should specify the size mug that fits. i will keep it because it works well.
__label__2 Works Well Keeping Coffee Warm: This works well to keep your coffee warm longer. It doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee.
__label__2 Awesome!!!!: I'm a huge tea drinker & I enjoy drinking coffee. But with my work, I'm constantly running around the office so if it wasn't for this warmer, my coffee & tea would be ice cold, but this warmer really keeps it luke warm. But of course the first few times there was a smell when my metallic mug is placed on the warmer. But now the smell is gone.
__label__1 Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed: It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
__label__1 Worthless Piece of Crap!: This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low. I made a cup of really nice organic Japanese Shade grown tea ($40 an ounce) and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for 10 minutes. The pad gets pretty hot, but not near hot enough to keep a cup of coffee hot. After something has been sitting on it for about 10 - 15 minutes you can gulp it with no fear of getting burnt. A Worthless piece of Crap. I will see if it works as a candle warmer.
__label__1 Not happy with this one!: I have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product. I tried pre-heating it and still no results. Very disappointed. I positively don't recommend this product.
__label__1 Doesn't keep coffee hot: Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.
__label__1 Disappointed: I am very disappointed in the Mr. coffee cup warmer. My coffee is really hot when I first put it on however on theMr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm. I can't stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion. Don't waste your money. Why can't they make a good coffee cup warmer? I am still looking
__label__1 disappointment: I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more, and some for friends. I could find only the "on/off switch" warmer (although it was initially called "mug-activated" on the screen) so ordered 2. As already stated, the coffee is kept only warm, and you definitely have to remember to turn OFF the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still ON, which could be a danger. I have been unable to find a mug-activated warmer, but continue the search because I do not believe this "on/off switch" is any good.
__label__1 What a rip off!: Three criticisms:1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.2. $3.00 for ten minutes!3. Cheesy coloration.
__label__2 westmoreland glassware review: Great history of the company, but I was disappointed in the little milk glass content. The author talks about how important the opal (milk) glass line was for business, but does not offer much samples of it in the book.
__label__1 DISAPPOINTING: This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points, but extremely weak on others. It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should. I would NOT recommend Kovar's books on any subject.
__label__1 Not what you think.........: If you read above, it says that there are 4 discs on this record. Then you look at the top and see only two discs. I expected the entire 4 disc collection, but got only two. So if this being advertised above as two and it says 4 down below, shouldnt this be corrected or is this a case of false advertising???
__label__1 truly boring: This book was a waste of my time - I bought the bundle and now I'm not going to bother reading any more of Ms Cruise's ghastly stories. The dialogue was atrocious (and not at all amusing), not once did I even crack a smile, let alone laugh out loud, and the plot was so neatly wrapped up that it underscored its decided lack of depth.Agree with another reviewer - if you want mystery and romance, read Janet Evanovich!
__label__2 Highly Recommended...: This is an Awesome CD done by Derryl Perry, Higly Recommend it. Most of the song He wrote and some collaborated with other songwriters like him, Outstanding Vocals and Musician plus Songwriter!!!
__label__1 Holes drilled incorrectly: Aside from missing a few bolts I also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly. I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem. This is as far as I have gotten in the assembly as I have ran out of daylight. I am sure when it is finally together it will be a 3/5 bench as opposed to my current 2/5 rating. The shipping went well as It got here on time.
__label__1 Stats Class Workbook: The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software, but only to send it back. I need the workbook for my class, and the class is in its fourth week. I have since ordered the software from the manufacturer.Jim McShane
__label__1 Too bad Galbraith isn't much of an economist.: Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers, it isn't because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them. He doesn't appear to understand them. This book reads like a fairy tale or child's letter to Santa Claus. Mr. Galbraith doesn't seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics 101. But he does have an excellent command of the English language.
__label__1 smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number): Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
__label__2 justice league done right finally: smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
__label__2 Smallville Season 9 Rocks!!!: There are some folks who dislike season 9, but that just because they still want to see Clark as that farm boy from Smallville. Yet, they don't realized that Clark is no longer the farm boy that we all love, but a news reporter who is embracing his destiny as the future superman. Yes, I still miss the Kent farm, The Talon, the Torch and even Smallville High School, but we must move on. In season 9, Clark is one step closer in being Superman, but he must first deal with his own personal issues, including his new love for Lois. I love seeing new heroes on the show, including Stargirl and Hawkman. Won't spoil more, but season 9 is far the best.
__label__2 smallville so far: i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc 2 many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood
__label__1 smallville season 9: needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
__label__2 mesmerizing marlene: If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film, the film would have been awful! Dietrich triumphs in a role no-one would have predicted. mysterious, mesmerizing, seductive, funny, and finally moving as the loyal gypsy(!) Lyddia, Dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws. At times the film drags by, some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak, and some of the dialogue is inane. Through it all, Dietrich is the soul of this movie, holding it all together in spite of the flaws, to make the whole thing work. Worth watching as a romantic piece of Hollywood escapism, and for seeing Dietrich as the fine actress she is.
__label__2 Why in the world did they choose full screen ?: This is one of my favorite movies. I own the Lasedisc on widescreen. I could not wait for the DVD. I can't understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only. What a shame!
__label__1 Pan and Scan? No thanks!: Rats. I was all ready to buy this movie, but the ephemistic "Full-screen format" (i.e. Pan and Scan) stopped me cold. The reason I bought a DVD player in the first place, besides the great running commentaries included with many movies, is so I could see the entire image the director intended, not some cropped 4:3 editted-for-television version.Call me a purist, but I just don't buy cropped DVDs like this one.
__label__1 Blu ray wouldn't play: I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine, so just don't get it unless you have a new Blu ray player.
__label__2 Love this movie: Great movie, lots of fun. I rent it every year so I bought it. It's a light movie with a great cast. It reminds me of home.
__label__2 Good DVD: this DVD is a good show. it is good to see DVDs still widely availible. DVD is able to have true stereo, and, or sourround sound.
__label__1 Why Is This Not Letterboxed?: I have rated the "DVD" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.
__label__2 Fullness, Balance, and Challenge: As if attending a crusade event in person, the reader will find the always compassionate, passionate, and caring Billy Graham pleading for unbelievers to believe, believers to come to the fullness promised to them as children of God, and for those needing clarity on this important subject to hit THE BOOK and discover through the Holy Spirit what they need. As I read, I kept thinking, "I miss Dr. Graham." Then, I turned on the TV and one of his "classic" crusade presentations was on a religious channel. You sometimes forget what a great teacher, preacher, evangelist and pastor he was.GREAT, GREAT book that will bless, challenge, and inspire you to reach higher in your walk with the Lord.
__label__1 NOT for introductory food: The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.
__label__2 Not my favorite diapers, but still great: I prefer Swaddlers to Baby Dry during the day, but they're hard to find in bigger sizes. These Baby Dry Pampers will hold a LOT. My son sleeps 10 to 12 hours a night (8 months old) and the diaper lasts all night without every leaking. These big packs from Amazon are fantastic, too. The price is less per diaper than from [...] and even Sam's Club plus Amazon does free Two-Day Shipping on diapers right now. (I won a free year of Amazon Prime for one of my diaper orders, too!) Can't beat that.
__label__2 auto delivery: I created an account to have diapers delivered to my daughter's house. Having twins, her life is busy enough. Free shipping, can't beat it. love this idea.
__label__1 Does not keep your baby dry: So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry.
__label__2 good diaper: These are good diapers that don't leak, even with overnight soakings. They don't hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers, however.
__label__2 Great diapers: Pampers and Huggies are, in our opinion, the best diaper brands out there. We have a slightly preference for Pampers because they look less "bulky" on the baby, compared to Huggies or store brands. And it is the best deal I have for diapers, considering the 15% discount from Amazon "Subscribe & Save" program. However, I've noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a "Subscribe & Save" item, so I am not sure whether I would buy it for the full price - I would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it.
__label__1 THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS!!!: Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!
__label__1 Leaks at the kid's belly: Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing.
__label__2 best diapers ever!: Well!We never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers.We've tried all other brands (Cheaper & expensive ones) and nothing comes close to diapers.
__label__2 Best Diapers Ever: From testing all kind of brands from every store possible Pampers Baby Dry is far most the best out there!
__label__2 i loved this item: i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country , so i had to cancel. My baby never had problem with these diapers.thanks.
__label__2 Best for the price: Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler, but I prefer them to the regular Huggies and like them equally as the Huggies Little Snugglers which are much more expensive. Very absorbent, never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for 12 hours at night.
__label__2 Good price, no wetness strip: Don't get confused here, this isn't a swaddler style diaper. There is NO, I repeat... NO wetness strip. This diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer. The diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy 2nd place choice to the same size Pamper Swaddler.
__label__1 Weren't So Great.: We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers, and these are nothing like the soft, meshy swaddlers. These are crunchy and thin like store-brand diapers. With swaddlers I could easily let my 3 month old go overnight without a diaper change, but these leaked all over the front of me when I picked him up in the morning. Hated them.
__label__1 New and Improved with Sagging Technology: It takes a lot for me to dislike a product, but these are terrible! After a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet, when in reality there was hardly anything in it. They don't seem to hold much before leaking, even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesn't prevent leakage. Definitely, not something I will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is.
__label__1 Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers!: My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But, even though they are less expensive, the Baby Dry type are not worth it! I found them cheap looking and feeling (they could have been mistaken for a store brand.) The absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad, my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet (there was not a fit issue, he was the correct weight for the size I bought, and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper, but literally from the seat.) From now on, I will definitely stick with the Pampers Swaddlers type.
__label__1 Horrible Diapers: I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also, they do not absorb at all...not worth the savings!
__label__2 Best for the Price: There are less expensive diapers out there, but I found that Pampers and Huggies might be more money, but are the better diaper too. I also found that Baby Dry diapers were the least expensive of the diapers that work. I have a girl and they work great. I really don't even price check anymore. I just get these using amazon mom and subscribe and save and get them as cheap as I can. I lot easier shopping for diapers when you have your favorite, and these are definitely my favorite.Edit October 2012: I now have another baby girl. I decided to give luvs a try again, and like them this time around. I didn't like them with my first daughter. Not sure if my opinion changed or if luvs changed their diaper up. There is definitely a different feel than other brands, but after amazon mom ended I started shopping again and now I get luvs from sam's club.
__label__1 no: We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
__label__1 "Baby Dry" but Covered with Poop: After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers, which max out in a size 2-3, we figured "Baby Dry" was the logical next step. *Every* time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit, her mother, the sofa--you name it. She is right in the size range. We will *not* be buying this diaper again.
__label__1 Quality dropped in the last 6 months: I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years.
__label__1 Worst Ever!!: these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
__label__1 There is a reason for cheaper price: Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter, baby dry was okay. You just have to change often though.
__label__2 The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!: These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
__label__2 the best but only this time: pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
__label__2 Swaddlers are better, but...: I wish Swaddlers went up to my son's size. He is 4 months old and already weighs 24 lbs. These are good, but Swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal. I have not yet tried the cruisers, but based on ratings, these seem to be what most prefer. I have not had any problems with these, excet my son outgrows them so fast! Each shipment I order, it seems I have to go up a size. Love Pampers products.
__label__2 Keeps baby dry and no diaper rash!: I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well, provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies don't get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid. My only complaint is the price. They are so darn expensive!
__label__1 Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry: When my son wheres Pampers, the poop always rides up his back. I am very disappointed in these diapers and can't believe all the positive reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does hold in pee alright for 3-4 hours max. These diapers don't perform as well as Huggies Snug & Dry.
__label__2 Best fit for my baby: This product is wonderful !! and the best fit for our baby. We tried Swaddlers because of a friend's recommendation, but our 6 month old got rashes within the first week of using it. We switched back to Baby Dry and the rash was gone within 3 days !! Definitely recommended by me.
__label__1 Fall Apart: I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking, I've had to throw out at least four brand-new diapers (so far) because the the entire side where the tab tears off while I'm trying to fasten the diaper. I've never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies, so I know it's not the operator. Also, these diapers don't seem to fit very securely. They tend to sag and feel very cheap (even my husband commented on that and he generally doesn't notice these kinds of things). I've only used about 20 diapers from my box of 140, but I'm sure I'll have more problems with tearing. What a waste!
__label__1 Leaky and expensive: These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.
__label__2 best for the $$$: these do a very, very good job. huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get. actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less. with the amount in the box - one case is good for almost a month. rarely leak - even w/ a 2 year old at night.
__label__1 Incomplete Shipment: The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
__label__1 Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY: We got a big box of "baby dry" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand, the "swaddlers" take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes. We are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers.
__label__2 Great diapers!: We have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer Pampers for our son. They fit him best and we very rarely have "explosions." This box is a great value.
__label__1 horrible diapers ever: Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!
__label__2 Maybe this will help...: A lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate -- the size of the 1-2s are the same as the 1s, but I noticed that the 1-2s have a blue liner. I am wondering if they're intended for babies who need the size of the 1s with the absorbancy of the 2s? Does anyone else know? Pampers doesn't have anything on their website...
__label__2 These are great diapers!: I have been using Pampers Baby-Dry diapers since Zach was only a few weeks old. These are the only diapers I will use on him. They are soft and comfortable for him. I can't say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper, but I would love to meet the mom who has never had a diaper mess at one point or other! LOL I have tried other diapers, but these seem to be the most comfy and best control against diaper accidents.
__label__1 No Good: The diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything. We found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour. Interestingly, the same Pamper diaper we bought from local supermarket or Walmart store was a lot better and could last for several hours.
__label__1 Baby Dry = Leaks!: We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers, cruisers or other store brand diapers. I couldn't believe how leaky these were!
__label__1 Pampers Baby Dry - not recommended: I purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the Pampers Swaddlers. I was wrong. I just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not. My baby girl is 6 months and is an average baby...not chunky or big (other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper)Here are my con's:-do not absorb like I need them to. She is up one to two times per night and if I don't change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and I will have to wash everything.-they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers.- when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her..it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs.yuck.They really are fine during the day, it is at nap and night time that she seems to over flow out of the diaper. I will not order another box of these. I was honestly shocked that they were not better because I really love pampers. Oh well. live and learn.
__label__2 Gr8 Product: My kid is enjoying , Daiper takes lot more time than other ones and still will be fresh and dry
__label__1 Not dependable: We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift, when his clothes and the sheets get wet.Prefer swaddlers any day.
__label__2 Best value: I already have good luck with Pampers So far, no complaints. People who are disappointed that there is no blue line, I thought it would make them like those I used to. Then I figured out the blue line only instead of Pampers Swaddlers Pampers diapers in the dry. I have started to buy diapers through Amazon only, because if you use Amazon subscribe and save discount they are cheaper than you can get even at a substantial discount in membership stores.
__label__2 Best Diapers: My little man sleeps 12-14 hours a night, and these are the BEST diapers for leak protection!! If you do the Amazon Mom subscribe & save, it's an even better deal than cheapo diapers! With subscribe and save, I get a box of these each month, delivered to my door. So fantastic & worry free. HIGHLY recommend.
__label__1 Good: I like the price and quantity in the package but I'm noticing now that they are holding up overnight. I've recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
__label__2 Good Diapers, Subscribe and Save rules!: Probably my 2nd favorite disposable I find them to be very reliable and they smell nice. However the scent does concern me and while all disposables contain chemicals I wonder about the more so when I'm using scented Pampers. Regardless, combined with Subscribe and Save this is a total win-win the price and service can't be beat. I'm a "part-time" cloth diaper user and subscribe and save has made filling in the gaps very easy I can't say enough how much I love it.
__label__1 Not as good as Cruisers: I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!
__label__2 Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack: I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
__label__2 Best diapers for us: I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save.
__label__2 Best Diapers at a great price: I've looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers, and Amazon has been the best (same price as my local stores, but they get delivered right to my door, free shipping) I calcuate the price per diaper, and Amazon is always the cheaper, or equal to other sites/local stores.As for the diaper itself, I love pampers brand (for diapers, not wipes) over any other diaper brand. I prefer the "baby dry" over the cruisers (for price and quality) and now that they make the baby dry with the "caterpillar stretch" sides, they're even better! They fit like a dream, even on my skinny little boy!!! My 18 month old son has been in pampers since the day he was born, and any leaks are VERY VERY rare, even overnight when he's sleeping 11+ hours.I am very price-aware, and Amazon and Pampers fit my budget perfectly!
__label__1 Gave a rash: I bought the XL case of Pampers Baby dry in size 3 and after only 5 diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches.My son's skin is not sensitive and we have used Pampers swaddlers, Hugggies Snugglers,Huggies Snug n Dry, Parents Choice and Comforts (kroger) brand and he has never had any issue.now I am stuck with this XL case of diapers.
__label__1 Not my favorite: We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
__label__1 Terrible Smell and Horrible Rash: We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now, with no problems (my son is 13 months, in size 4). I saw the price on Amazon and with the 30% off, it was a great deal. However, when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical-like. I gave them a day to air out, which they did, but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash. He has only had tiny rashes 3-4 times in the past, but this one is continuous and awful-looking. We are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately, and going back to the Wholesale club. I don't think it's Baby Dry, per se, but the shipment that Amazon has. It really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price -- they need to be tossed and NEVER touch a baby's skin.
__label__2 Great deal..: when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
__label__2 Gr8 product & Gr8 deal from Amazon: Wonderful product at a great deal from Amazon.Babies will luv them.ALL stars. I am in for repeat orders for the Pampers diapers.
__label__2 awesome! I save a lot of money: It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
__label__2 Good diaper: This is the best diaper I have found next to the old Pampers Cruisers. They are not as soft as I'd like and they don't have a liner like I'd want, but they don't leak even after a 12 hour night with my heavy wetter. They are more economical than the new Pampers Cruisers and I think probably a better diaper overall anyway.
__label__1 Pampers: These pampers were the worst, my son was soaked. Every nightI Switched to o overnight ones which are great, no leaks
__label__2 great: Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
__label__1 Not absorbant enough: I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.
__label__1 Leak with breastfeed poop up the back!: These diapers leek up the back when my baby poops! Then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on! Annoying!!
__label__2 Great for the price!: I love these diapers. i have been using it for my son during the day. with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price. i think 50% discount is very good. its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
__label__1 Not what the name implies!: My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers, thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the Huggies. To my surprise, they are neither softer or more absorbent. I'm very disappointed and have had to change many skirts, and pants because of this!I am planning on writing to Kimberly Clark as well regarding this. Also, these diapers run small!
__label__1 Not good for night times: Target diapers are much better than these diapers. My daughter sleeps through the night. When she wakes up her dress, the sheet everything will be wet. This diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night.
__label__1 hyped!: Walt Whitman's literary reputation has been hyped by "gay" critics (I suspect). I'm not totally hostile to free verse; in fact, I like T.S. Eliot, the most famous proponent of this genre, but Whitman wrote ramblingly, seemingly devoid of poetic coherence that the reader's creative imagination is left unstirred. I agree with Robert Frost, the truly great American poet, that writing poetry without the classic, conventional rules is like playing tennis--with no net.
__label__2 Book Review: This book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff. At the same time, the subject matters cover a lot of matters that I've wanted to read for a while.I suggest that you do not read his poetry silently. Say it all out loud! They're meant to be read loud and proud. Trust me, that's worth it.
__label__1 Rip Off: This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents, which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overall.Save your dollar and look elsewhere.
__label__1 A Mistake: A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I, but Whitman grew on me, and over the next several months, I learned to appreciate his work.However, I left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump, discovering secrets that this co-worker and I had together. I now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it.
__label__1 Shameful: In my opinion, this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage. My five year old was in TEARS because we could only find five second clips of actual skating. To make matters worse, there doesn't seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events, even if one is willing to pay for it. Nor does the Olympic website itself have videos of the events. I could understand if we were searching the week of the Olympics, or even that month. However, it's been close to a year. SHAME ON YOU NBC. The Olympics are not yours.
__label__1 Did I watch the same movie???: Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were "ok" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before. The story-line was.. ummm. well, nevermind.Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end???? I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious!
__label__1 .... HYBRID CD is a joke !!: ...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...
__label__2 Power Off Solution?: I've had my 940MW for over a year. When 1st received, after turning on, it would work for 5 to 10 minutes and then cut off. I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off. Then I tried a different approach. I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars. SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE!I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC. Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact. I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be. I think that that caused the problem.Don't know if this helps anyone else.That is the only reason I don't give this monitor a 5 rating.
__label__1 bad power suplly: i bought this 18 months ago. i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up.$90.00 later it's working again. Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
__label__1 Does not adhere (peels off): So I tried this on a few things- attaching a leather strap to a suede bag I made, repairing leather sandal straps and trying to repair a shoe sole. The leather strap pulled off, the sandal repair came apart on vacation and the shoe sole didn't adhere properly, so it started to come off. When I pulled on the side that was coming off it pulled off in one big chunk. It seems like the glue sticks very well to itself, but not to the other materials you are trying to attach. And yes, I followed all of the instructions to a T. Still looking for a better shoe/leather glue.
__label__2 It Sticks!: The glue was easy to apply. My boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places ... Unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasn't one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay
__label__2 Love this stuff: Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
__label__2 Shoe Goo: Shoe Goo works great. The bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling. I applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry 24 hours. Next day the tennis shoe was good. Shoe Goo really works! For the size, I should buy a smaller Shoe Goo.
__label__2 Beginning with Audrey growing up during WWII brought integrity.: I learned a lot about Audrey Hepburn's childhood that I had never realized before. Beginning in WWII brought the story home and made it real.
__label__2 What kind of person could have done this...: Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect, then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect. The author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book, but rather point us in the right direction. For example, he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of Jack the Ripper (interestingly this does not seem to match Patricia Cornwell's conclusion) and the Zodiac. His discussion of the Ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case. A well written and interesting book.
__label__1 General Overview of Bizarre Cases, too obtuse for crime scholars.: A Dummy's Guide to Understanding Bizarre Murder Cases.-I would read this if you were a new immigrant to the Western world. So, i would look around for weightier books ,on a specific crime topic.This book is too broad and not informative enough .The reason why these cases haunt the FBI is that they need to turn on the light-switch.
__label__2 Fascinating Read: I don't typically read this kind of work, but picking it up at a real bargain price, it looked interesting, given all the media attention this renown profiler receives.His analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities, honed over years of work. He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas: context of area in which crime committed and victomology.From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping. The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one. Also, that Gen. Schwartzkopf's relative was involved.These cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery, especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out.
__label__2 Why doesn't Clay get played anymore!!!: Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
__label__2 My wife loves it: The stones are a bit small, and not as colorful as the picture, but the necklace is beautiful and well made. Interesting clasp with a non-rolling chain. Nice.
__label__1 POOR QUALITY: This is a very poor quality necklace. I needed to take it in direct light before I could see any stones, nothing like picture shown. No bill in the box, so sadly, I am unable to return.
__label__1 Really BAD: The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
__label__1 SKIPPING CD'S: MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
__label__2 If you're a "difficult" size/in a time crunch: I had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding, and I was distressed by how little I could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores. Amazon was the last place I looked and this is the first thing that popped up, and it's perfect. It fits, it's appropriate, and it's cheap and fast. If you're plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are [especially if you have an ounce of taste and don't like the traditional plus size color palette/prints], this is your solution. Also, the only alternatives I found were all "special order at least two months ahead" gowns. Hello, who does anything two months ahead any more? If time is not a luxury you can afford, this is your solution as well.
__label__2 In the rain or in the snow, got the got the funky flow.: This is the soundtrack to the classic Playstationgame. If features all the songs from the game, plus all the instrumental music cues. The songs, most of which are rap songs, are really cute and amusing. The instrumentals are similarly "cutesy", and almost all of them are under a minute long (a few are less than ten seconds long). If you are a fan of this game, I'm sure you will enjoy the soundtrack.
__label__2 easy to understand guide: When my 6 year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, my family was devastated. Her parents are both RNs, and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments. I have absolutely no medical background, and I found this book to be very helpful. This book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments, commonly used drugs, different types of brain and spinal cord tumors, etc. that were easy for a layperson to understand. I also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer, it made me feel like we weren't alone. There are new treatments that come out all the time, so obviously some of the information may be dated, but overall I thought this was an excellent guide for anyone caring for a child with brain cancer.
__label__1 Not pleased: I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons. First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language, which is its whole purpose. Secondly, I felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what I was always supposed to be doing. My advice is to consider a competitor's product before this one. A good alternative product to look at would be Italian Now by Transparent Language, which is very well done.
__label__2 BibleMan a great Video: Absolutely wonderful video, my preschoolers love it and now go around playing Bibleman the hero, They shout out "Word Power" to fight bad guy. This is a great improvement from playing slash and shoot them-up. The price was great.
__label__1 There's a reason this was only on TV: The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand, but was disappointed with the movie itself.-Looks like a low-budget made for TV movie which it is.-Casting was poor. Outside of George C. Scott these were a bunch of B or C actors. Richard Dysart as Eisenhower was particularly bad.-As noted in many other reviews, the video quality was poor.-Way too long and way too depressing.I was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar Patton and less of George C. Scott lying in a hospital bed. If they cut off the last third of the movie, it might be four stars.I recommend you pass on this movie, at the very least stop watching after the accident. He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies. There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting.
__label__2 excellent healthy eating book: Love the book, has many recipes in it. I have used many of them and they not only taste good but do help u feel better
__label__2 11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack: The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
__label__1 Received just one canvas: The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
__label__2 Philip K. Dick would be proud!: This film is actually four short films... One film (The Robot Fixer) actually has little to do with technology or "robotics" as we usually perceive it (Lets play, "One of these films is not like the others"), while the others are very good speculative fiction pieces which make you go hmmm. I thought that Pak made the most use of his time and pulled the viewer into each story universe quite thoroughly.After a week of working 16 hour days in the astrodome after the Hurricane Katrina survivors came in, it was the perfect way to spend my first evening back with the family! I highly recommend.
__label__1 Defective Machine - Don't buy!: I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. At first, the cofee was great. Then a couple of weeks later, coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor! I thought maybe I had a bad machine, so I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one. A month later, same problem! The coffee pours around the caraffe, not into it. I burned myself trying to clean it up, and it stained my nice kitchen floors. I'm taking it back for a different brand coffee maker, I won't be fooled three times!
__label__2 Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles: I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy.
__label__2 Supreme Coltrane: A wonderful and creative album. Great listening from start to finish. Belongs in every jazz library along with Blue Train, Giant Steps, and Kind Of Blue.
__label__2 wow!: I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
__label__2 Five stars?: There are not enough stars in the sky, and no words I can say here that will do it justice.
__label__2 Spirituality in sound supreme: A LOVE SUPREME was for John Coltrane, both an intensely personal statement, and a gift to mankind. On the brink of ruination due to alcohol and drug abuse, Coltrane had a life altering epiphany in 1957. On the liner notes to the album he writes:"During the year 1957, I experienced by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music."A LOVE SUPREME was recorded in 1964 after the death of his friend, Eric Dolphy, and the birth of his 1st son. These events must have inspired Coltrane to create his masterpiece. Outside of Bach's B Minor Mass, I can't think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music. Whether or not you are into Jazz, you should listen to A LOVE SUPREME at least once in your life.
__label__2 Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p: I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
__label__1 Phone Cover: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain.
__label__2 Luck of the Irish: I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my wife who is Irish...she loves it....so do I and I'm not Irish.
__label__2 Crazy and totally wonderful: A thoroughly wonderful movie that had me laughing in no time. Melanie Griffith is outstanding in this zany story. Highly recommend
__label__1 Disappointed: I own another Sony VCR (SLV N-71) which is nice. This one was for the kids, but it's going back. The VCR is noisy - very distracting. Picture is fair. I expect more from Sony products.
__label__2 Great 80's Concept Album !: It's moody, a little dark, like for driving down the highway at night . . . But that's why I loved it in the 1980's ! I just was never able to find the CD ! To me, it is the most well-done, well-produced album by Tommy Shaw, as I have heard most of his others to date . . . Still, yes, it has a certain heavy keyboard-80's sound, but it is more 'serious' than his other efforts in my humble opinion . . .So, dark, but GREAT guitar, it should have really been the concept for another Styx album, instead of the more light-wieght stuff they all have done . . .
__label__1 Complete Failure: This Album Offers Absolutely Nothing Worth Wasting Time With. Shaw Had One Minor #33 Hit With "Girls With Guns", But Nothing On This One. People Forget That Shaw Only Contributed One Top 40 Hit (Too Much Time...) On His Final Three Albums With Styx, Before They Broke Up. Without Nugent And Blades His Career May Have Ended Here.
__label__2 anything KMFDM: Better than 2002 tour - BUT GUYS NEED AN UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT VERSIONS OF YOUR MUSIC - like a 2012 dvd.....PLEASE! Love them!!
__label__1 Don't buy this book!: Only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser, it's ALL your fault and there's nothing you can do about it, EVER! I'm not even going to pass this book on, it's going in the trash! That being said, there are some great kids social skills books out there: 1.) The unwritten rules of friendship 2.) Nobody likes me, everybody s me 3.) Good friends are hard to find
__label__1 Valeo WW2 2-lb wrist weights: I used the weights once. Well, they almost made it..one of the wrist weights came apart at the seam and sand leaked all over the carpet.
__label__1 Valeo wrist weights: The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
__label__2 lite up: The bulb seems ok, the batteries have power, but the laser light does not work.The bulb came in 4days.
__label__1 I haven't received my items: It has been a month after the estimated date my items would have reached me and they haven't. Can you check on this???
__label__2 Have fun with your baby!: I love this DVD! Get ready to have fun and interact with your baby. This DVD gives you so many ideas to have fun and interact with you baby by just using items you already have around your house. I loved the bright colors, the music, Eeebee and the Mom. I highly recommend this DVD to all parents.
__label__1 Dissapointed: I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine, and also from the reviews posted here. I feel Eebee DVD's are geared to children age 3-15 months when babies are just starting to move around. Little Eebee could not hold my toddler's attention. It was a waste of money for my 2 year old
__label__1 Buy a different guidebook: This guidebook is a waste of money - info is too scattered and does not address areas I will be visiting
__label__1 Very disappointing: I liked the characters. He did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters. However the plot was awful. At the end I was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book. It's almost as though you're left wondering exactly what happened at the end.
__label__1 Another spin on socializing costs/risks and privatizing profits: What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
__label__2 brill: this album is a must have. look for the similarities between sunny day and jane's addiction in 100 million - i swear it's there. every track is incredible - be warned that listening to it in already-sad states will lead to probably more sadness, but it's good to be there sometimes.
__label__1 I Hate to Disagree, But...: Well, I have to say that I didn't really want to write a negative Sunny Day review, but then I thought of the unfortunate lads who would waste their money on this CD instead of buying a different Sunny Day CD. I am a big fan (driving 6 hours to see them play in a couple weeks) but I was kinda let down by this one. Diary and Self-Titled are strongly recommended.
__label__1 A great disappointment: A am a huge SDRE fan, but to tell you the truth their new CD wasn't all that good, their old stuff was way better. SDRE has lost their style and emotion. This CD isn't worth buying.
__label__1 Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple...: Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia, it is unfulfilling. Mdm. Ranevskaya's Orchard is bought under her feet by a "friend" whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her. So this is the transformative moment: Mdm. Ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession, and then what? Her friend, Lopahin, feins innocense, Mdm. Ranevskaya runs off to Paris to whom or what? We never find out. It's sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground.
__label__1 Author needs to take grade school writing lessons: "I didn't say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening, and there isn't really any way out once Uncle Frank gets you, except holding your breath for a really, really long time, which might spoil the day for everyone else, even though the ambulance would come and I would get to ride inside it while they saved my life."Verbatim quote of the author's writing abilities. I myself had a hard time trying to understand some of these sentences - imagine my first grader's annoyance.Run-on sentences, mixed verb tense, missing punctuation, you name it. The book should be called "Bad writing lessons." The editor must have been out sick the day this manuscript was turned in.Give it to a kid you dislike to repulse them away from reading.But the illustrations are nice. So, one star for that.
__label__2 Jane is a girl with spunk!: My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl, Jane, is smart and funny and spunky. It's a great story!
__label__2 One of the most disturbing "war movies" ever made.: Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema.
__label__2 Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry: Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!
__label__1 Swimming against the tide, but...: An improvisation is wonderful, if, and this is a huge if, an improvement on the original is made. After listening to all 15 cuts I have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to. Can you really expect Montero to improve on Vivaldi? That really is too much. However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi, why would I spend money to listen to Montero? This revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities, but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material.My advice, and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far, is that if you like Vivaldi, listen to Vivaldi, not Montero seeking to change Vivaldi. Or Bach. Or Scarlatti. Or Pachebel...The original is stunning...the alterations to it are just misc. music.
__label__1 Ho-hum: Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song, and it is what gave it two stars. Not horrible, but the music is generic movie soundtrack music. The two versions of "You Got A Friend In Me" add nothing to the song. "When She Loved Me" is a nice song performed wonderfully by Sarah Mclachlan, but not enought to spend money on this whole CD.
__label__2 Amazing soundtrack: This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. "When She Loved Me" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie, and paid any attention to the music at all, the soundtrack is a must. I put it in my CD player, sit back, and relax. I'll listen to this one for years to come.
__label__1 spirit of christmas: i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
__label__2 The Bible Made Easy: This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an "easy read."It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy
__label__1 Absurd Plot: The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in "The Godfather" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you.
__label__2 A fine read: Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain, and get you thinking.Secret deals with the message the Holy Virgin gave to the children at Fatima -Has some of the grace of Angels and Demons, but not the wild ride of an ending, although a satisfactory one.Definitely worth reading.
__label__2 Better than The Templar Legacy or The Amber Room: Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content, this yarn is similar to Dan Brown's Angels and Demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage Vatican politicking. It starts just a bit slow, but has a satisfying build-up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page-turner for those who won't get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current Catholic church and its various doctrines. While there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and aren't along the way, I found myself entertained and turning pages and, after all, isn't that really the point of a mass market thriller? Donald J. Bingle, Author ofForced Conversion.
__label__2 Very entertaining: This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
__label__1 A few minutes of horror: There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary. The actions by the characters were dreary. The only sign of life comes from the fiancée -- a strong, dynamic performance by attractive Yu Seon.TO see Jun Ji Hyun at her best, I recommendMY SASSY GIRL,DAISY, orIL MARE.
__label__2 A hair to the right, and maybe too soon: Strikes me as too soon to produce reliable history about a period so recent. He seemed a hair right-of-center but at least didn't fall into the mythology of Reagan "winning" the cold war. He mentions Clinton as "slick" a couple times but in his previous 1945-74 history I don't think (memory may be wrong) he ever used Tricky Dick or Slippery Richard about Nixon.
__label__2 Great Collection - Ready for more!!!: While I'm a big fan of this collection, along with the continuing collection "1935-1940", I'd be really interested in knowing if JSP is planning on putting out a collection of Cab's 1940-1947 stuff. If such a collection exists from JSP & I'm just being ignorant, please let me know!
__label__2 Changed my life: there have been others books similar to this one, but nearly ALL of the authors of those books have been trained directly or indirectly by Ron LeGrand. He is truly the guru of real estate investing. This book gives solid, practical advice that works in the real world. Yes, he tries to sell you additional things, but all you have to do is follow the instructions and you will have success.A great book that opened my eyes to a world of possibilities, which included early retirement.
__label__1 Stale, refund requested, but never received: The candy we received was not edible. It had long ago expired. We requested a refund, but it never came through. Avoid this vendor.
__label__2 THE Ultimate Food for your Lories: This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
__label__2 Do Fish Sleep: Full of very interesting info. which we probably never needed to know Bought for a 14 year old who really liked some of his previous books.
__label__2 TiVo: Got this to have at my son's house when I visit. I love it! They love it too! Easily set up, never miss a show again!!
__label__2 Busy little bee!: I like every thing about my TiVo----except---- It is so busy running around the networks finding things to record. some thimes i want to record the end of a movie or program i'm watching and i have to go into the programing an stop it from recording it has found, before i can record what I want.
__label__1 If you liked getting scammed by Comcast's "You don't have to do a thing when Digital arrives" then you'll love the Series2: The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital, your Series2 has become more like a Series0.50, since it only records one channel at a time.
__label__1 TiVo TCD49080 Series2: This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!
__label__2 Original shipment not complete, but great service fixed it!: I ordered the TiVo and it was shipped the next day (Friday). I received it in less than a week after I ordered it. When I got it, it was missing the remote. After contacting the seller, he ordered a new remote and had it sent to me as well as a "how-to" book just for the inconvenience that I encountered.Very good customer service, I would order again from this seller any time.
__label__1 A perfect waiste of money: When I bought the TiVo, I was told that this item would tape 2 different programs at the same time. When it didn't work, I called that company and they told me that because I had DirectTV, it was impossible to use the TiVo like I wanted to. I was totally cheated. I then bought the DirectTV's type of Digital REcorder, and it's the best thing I've ever done. It records 2 different programs at exactly the same time. TiVo told me that it only works on Cable. Bah Humbug. This is NOT explained when you want to buy the item. Buyers Beware
__label__1 Return: I do not have any problems with Amazon...But I have problem with FireWallSalesNew York.I had return this TIVO almost three weeks ago. I had wrote tothem and I told them that I had sent it back due they was going to charge me$20.00 a month.I have Dish TV and they harge only me $6.00 a month. Ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my TIVO.They writeback to tell that they will let me know.Now it's going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problem.I think that I am going to better businessin the state of New York.I am very upset with this company.They have noPride if they did they would of taken care of me......Noris
__label__1 Not up to par: I have long been a fan of Muriel Spark's, truly enjoying her humor and style. I liked her autobiography as well. But this book is a great disappointment. The characters are shallow: in particular, Dr. Wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable. There is a certain sense of haste: events are barely sketched, and it is all quickly brought to a conclusion, without going into any detail. A very thin book indeed, which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation.
__label__2 Zane Grey: I was really surprised that there was another Nevada book by Zane Grey. I had originally wanted another copy of the first book, Nevada, but when I saw this one I just had to buy it. Thanks!
__label__1 Good to see that fans are keeping the place clean: It's sad, but it happens - bootleg CDs get put up for sale on Amazon and they can't remove them fast enough. I commented on two other bootleg sales and can't find them any longer, obviously Amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place. Some people just don't have any shame at all.If you're going to call on Amazon to remove these CDs, you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller, remove any means to buy the item and mark it as fake. That way, no customer would ever have to be fooled again.
__label__1 *Thumbs Down*: This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself "Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one.
__label__1 Judge a Book by Results: I purchased this book over a year and a half ago, and I have yet to win big. I have studied this book from cover to cover, and use it with Lotto:How to Wheel a Fortune,also by Gail Howard. Anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties. In theory, Lottery Master Guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds, but sad to say, I do not feel it lives up to its claims. I personally, would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book.
__label__2 The GUIDE for serious players.: Difficult to win anything on your own. $$$ outlay by individual players is too large. Better start a pool at the office with co-workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems. You'll share winnings and losses (small and both sides unless you hit the Jackpot). No other book comes close. Get your rabbit's foot, or any other totem for luck! You'll need it.
__label__1 Resie This!: Give it up everyone, Rammstein is dead. This album is so soft it doesn't even deserve to be a German based CD. Not even Rosenrot can save this album.They have sold-out, producing a soft, nu-metal tainted record that can't compare to their other amazing albums.RIP RAMMSTEIN
__label__1 What the fascination?: Thurber revealed "The secret Life of Walter Mitty." DuBar should have kept his life a secret unrevealed!A lot about the drinking and useless meanderings of Jules DuBar, written in a painfully simplistic and predictable style. DuBar's life is not interesting, except in the fact that a highly educated man so often behave so coarsely. (But geologists often took pride in that kind of behavior back when. Very macho, those guys!) Save your money, or toss it in a river, but avoid this book.
__label__1 Not for chevy s10 pickup: One bushing fits the other doesnt, I chose to make it fit....will implode into itself seeing as its brass and squeak to caboose but its better than your door not shutting.
__label__1 Incorrect parts in package: I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
__label__2 One of the Best Buffy Eps: Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos. It is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myself...all of the books are good too!
__label__2 Phenomenal Video!: This is an absolutely phenomenal video account of Alaska! The videography, music, and narration combine to make this a relaxing and educational viewing experience all wrapped up in one. My family and I truly enjoyed watching this video together, and it definitely made us want to travel to Alaska at some point ourselves! Thanks for sharing your trip and obvious love and respect for our natural wonders!
__label__1 A Huge Dissapointment, Not a Complete Guide: I believe Al Ristori to be a well respected Fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase manner.But this book fails to live up to that reputation.It is definitely not a " complete guide to Saltwater Fishing ".Almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for free.This book was clearly not a labor of love and Al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coin......and has disappointed me in the process....
__label__1 Publisher?: I found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining, however I attempted to write a paper about it for school, but there is no publisher information or translator. I do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers.
__label__2 A good reference for basic techniques: I was looking for some more advanced features than were offered, but it looks like it will be helpful to me moving forward. I build alot of forms in Adobe Acrobat. If you have never done javascript in Acrobat, or have intermediate knowledge, it may be a helpfull book for you.
__label__1 Mixed Up: This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one.
__label__2 A True Romance - One of Garwood's Best: I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!
__label__1 Killing your dog: In the chapter on Pets, Zahn lists "euthanizing your companion" as an option if "Fido or Kitty will not take kindly- ever- to your baby." (p103)This struck me as rather compassionless, especially for a book about parenting. She could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions, and left it at that.
__label__2 Wonderful: This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view. Informative and emotional at the same time. Wonderful.
__label__2 Wanting to be a bombshell!: I bought this DVD almost a year ago. I finally decided to use it and I am happy that I did. I did find the DVD very helpful, the workouts are not long and there are some rest periods throughout each workout. In my opinion workout 2 is the hardest, I am not a fan of burpees at all but they do get easier. I do not really rest during the breaks, if I need a rest I take it, if not I fast forward to the next section. Overall a great workout! I will probably get her next DVD. I am new to the kettlebell thing and I am using a 10 pound bell. This seem like just the right size for a beginner.
__label__1 For beginners...: I have been a exercise dvd junkie for years, Kettlebell dvds also. Although I like the exercises presented, I have some issues with her form. I know from personal experience, if you don't have your form correct, you can cause injury to other parts of your body as I did with my knees. Also, if you're advanced, you will be working out without her instruction, as she only does the beginner workout with you. Normally, trainers will either let beginners know when their time is up and continue on with the advanced exercisers. Lisa stops working out at the beginners level, which leaves you still working out by yourself, hopefully, finishing in time for the next exercise. I did pick up some good exercises but don't use this dvd as often as I would have liked. I will be sending it down the "resell" road.
__label__1 Horrible!: I can't believe how awful this movie was and I love zombie movies. It was like watching a SyFy movie of the week. Waste of $$$$. Sucked.
__label__2 Good series, bad doll: Well, if you are looking for a synopsis of the series, look at disk 1.This is probably one of my faovrite animes, and it's about time they brought it to the USA.Well now the important notes. This series DVDs as with most anime series DVDs are being released every other month. The doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated. I think mile long legs are great, but 2-3 mile long legs. Just get the regular DVD and save yourself a 10 spot.
__label__2 Great for AP: Biotutor is an invaluable tool for any student taking AP Biology or struggling in a Biology class. Last year I took regular Biology and did very well. I think my average was an A or A-. But, thinking I was such a good Biology student I took AP. It was not the same their is more math in it than I expected. But thankfully I found Biotutor and am now a great Bio student.
__label__1 Old Program, Poor Tutoring: The product once installed looks like its from 1990, and all it does is quiz you. It doesn't really explain anything and it's not very interactive. [...]
__label__1 waste of paper and money!: As a list of what carts were made, it's ok. As a price guide this book is complete garbage. The prices it lists are guaranteed to get you laughed at and chased out of every video game store in America, if not the entire world.
__label__1 pointless documentary: I mistakenly purchased this due to the similarity with the cover and STALINGRAD - DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER. This turned out to be just a pointless documentary on STALINGRAD like so many that had gone before. My bad...
__label__2 Sterling Silver Hoop Charm Peace Sign Earrings: Earrings came quickly and as described. Hard to find these little peace sign earrings in a style that is not obnoxious. Perfect gift for 70's sister.
__label__1 Disappointed: After reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through Amazon, I ordered this item, hoping it would work. It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine.
__label__2 A woman's transformation/ a professor's redemption: "Educating Rita" can be enjoyed at many levels of understanding. It can simply bring pleasure and good feelings. And it can be understood as a story of love that is harnessed for the growth of each person involved in the mentoring relationship. For a woman who has to take her own journey, it is validating. For a stale and jaded teacher, it is instructive. For any love relationship that develops between student and teacher, it shows - in the very best light - what can happen to each when they recognize the true purpose of their exciting and marvelous luck in being brought into each others lives. That luck is: nothing short of the transformation of both of them.It is my wish that life could be lived more often at this level, with passion, determination, humour, guts and grace.
__label__1 soundtrack: can any body please tell me who made the music for the soundtrack?i want to know please tell me.thanx
__label__2 Most Useful: This has become one of my most valued counseling companions. For those of you who are familiar with Glasser's Choice Theory, this is a great look into his actual practice techniques as he relates real case studies he has lead and how he has applied CT in real-life situations.Great read as well as a super resource.
__label__2 A full range of emotions....: If you enjoy books that take you through the full range of emotions, I think you'll enjoy this story. It's a study of the human spirit that gives hope to all, no matter your circumstance. Full of caring, love, and compassion, the author seems to have a heart as big as Wyoming. My only wish was that the story had been longer...or that I can hope for a sequel.
__label__1 Horrible book...: I had to read "Jim the Boy" for my freshman english course summer reading and thought that it was a horrible choice. It had no substance and was too easy to read. Although some apparently disagree, not a good choice for anyone over four years old.
__label__2 Poignant and beautiful: This publication is absolutely beautiful. The stories, the pictures they all capture the unthinkable events of 9/11. I would recommend this book highly!
__label__2 How to tickle your funny bone.: If you want to spend a fun evening with someone, watchingthis DVD is the perfect way to do it. It had us both institches. Bill Engvall is funny, funny, funny and doesn'thave to use foul words to do it.
__label__2 Kai Hansen strikes again: No wonder it sounds alot like Helooween. Kai Hansen, and some other former members of Helloween are in this band, which is actually a side/hobby-project for Kai Hansen and friends, disgruntled with not being able to play 80's style power metal, they formed this great band on the side of their regular bands, like Gamma Ray and other bands.Also worth noting is the fact that they've just released a 4-track mini-CD, "Coming Home." I bought it only yesterday, and it, needless to say, ROCKS! There's a live version of "Atlantis is Falling". The cover of Judas Priest's "The Rage" is also terrific.
__label__2 What! What! No Limits on the rise again!: Easily one of the dopest cds of the year 2000, but it'll probably get slepped on, because the haters are in full effect when it comes to No Limit. This cd can be listened to from the begining to the end without skipping a single song. The beats are excellent, even without Beats by the pound, the new production team is holding their own. You got to feel C-Murders maturity on this cd, hes taking his game to a whole other level. K-blaque----puttin it down for NoLimitsoldiers.com
__label__1 EXPECTS TO MUCH FROM THE READER.. NOT GOOD FOR BEGINERS: THE BOOK COVERS A LOT OF STUFF AT ONCE IT SHOULD BE CALLED LEARNING TO PROGRAM THE HARD WAY DONT RECOMMEND FOR BEGINNERS MEABY JUST MEABY FOR ADVANCED PROFESSORS ..SORRY MY OPNION..DONT RECOMMEND IT TO LEARN FROM IT AS FIST VB BOOK AND BY THE WAY THE AUTHOR HAS A LOT OF GREAT BOOKS THE FIRST ONE I THINK WAS BETTER
__label__2 Rockin' Scandinavians: I heard this group on the radio and had to have their cd, which I like very much. My only disappointment is that my favorite track, Sinklars vise, is incomplete. The singer is cut off midsentence and it was a longer song on the radio. Even though I can't understand the words, the rhythms are mesmerizing.
__label__1 Horrible ending: I was totally enthralled by this entire series, even the Sherlock Holmes style story of Stonecutter but this ending was horrible. Took a perfectly good sword and sorcery series and turned it sci-fi. I'll read sci-fi when I want that, I read this series for magic and swordplay. I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out.
__label__2 An Excellent Edition of Sesame and Lilies: This is an excellent edition of John Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies, the best I have found. The editors have not gone footnote-crazy; there are fortunately few. Supplementary materials such as the intro, chronology and glossary are well done and interesting, and the critical essays included are varied and very much worth reading. This ed. is part of Yale's "Rethinking the Western Tradition" series, all of which are well done.
__label__2 Outstanding: Marriott was the man, and deserves to be remembered, but the fact that he was one of the best R&B vocalists this country's ever produced means anyone trying to do his songs justice is probably, with all the best intentions, going to struggle. Steve Ellis comes closest to hitting the notes, the best of his tracks being Song Of A Baker. Dennis Greaves, Simon "Honeyboy" Hickling, and Midge Ure all perform well. Both the tracks by Deborah Bonham are outstanding, in particular (If You Think You're) Groovy, which is easily the best thing on the album. The tracks by Weller/Gallagher/McLagen et al are good, but you'd expect better. As for Tony Rivers ripping the throat out of Itchycoo Park, the less said about it the better.Review in brief: Good Tracks - 18 out of 21. Best Track: (If You Think You're) Groovy, Deborah Bonham. Worst Track: Itchycoo Park, Tony Rivers. Worth buying? Yes, because the good tracks make up for the bad ones.
__label__2 If you are a entrepreneur, you must read this book: I wanted to start my own business, but I knew nothing about entrepreneurship. After reading this book, I feel confident about my new business venture. It is impossible to explain how valuable a tool this book is.
__label__2 Anecdotes help illustrate the practical and important ideas: 4 Secrets Of High Performing Organizations: Beyond The Flavor Of The Month To Lasting Results is a "user friendly" business manager's guide that emphasizes the importance of not falling into business or marketing "fads". Instead, business managers and supervisors can establish profitable and efficient organizations by using basic, solid principles of dialogue with the folks who really know what's going on, by keeping things clear and open, by effectively measuring success and excellence, and by balancing cost vs. quality.

Anecdotes help illustrate the practical and important ideas in this highly recommended instructional reference designed specifically for anyone having a responsibility at any level for the success and profitability of a business enterprise.
__label__1 ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS: For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella, THE DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey. This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down.
__label__2 This highly surprising telling....: ...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
__label__2 Well-written, thought-provoking, British mystery.: I've given away at least a dozen copies. I don't want to spoil anyone's delight in reading, but I will say that the content remains controversial. Debby Goldstein
__label__2 Give Tey a try.: Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower "done in?" That is one of the great mysteries of history, and Tey "solves" it in the Daughter of Time. Some critics consider this the greatest mystery novel ever written, and I concur. Have read hundreds of mysteries, many of them marvelous,but The Daughter of Time is the best.There are those who think Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is best. I don't because I had correctly figured out who the murderer was by page 2.
__label__2 Mystery for history buffs (or a history for mystery buffs): Josephine Tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history. Was Richard III the evil murderer of the princes -- or not?I think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery (two of my favorite areas) and reread it regularly. So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery, this was an easy choice (backed up by it's ranking as one of Amazon's best mysteries of the Century). Well, they hated it. Why bother solving a centuries old mystery? So I offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or English history. Others may not care for it.
__label__2 A "big" short read: Wonderfully written and hugely educational, taking the reader from the theory of historical evidence to the stories of King Richard III
__label__1 poor quality: These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area. For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months.
__label__1 Ripped off.: I recently bought these silk pajamas for my husband's birthday. Within a week, all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed 2 - 3 inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs. I paid $160 dollars for these pajamas, more than silk PJs listed from other suppliers on Amazon, expecting I was buying quality. After a week's use, they are heading for the rag bag and I feel defrauded.
__label__1 Very disappointed: This arrived in a different package and bottle than shown. The box has tear marks and is beat up. It also has a nasty, dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed. What a great looking Christmas gift this will make.
__label__1 Paper feed nightmare: I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed. Not long after I bought this model (but too late to return)it started having problems with the paper feed. I now have to hand feed each piece of paper, and even then it sometimes doesn't work. The print quality is fine, but what good is it if you can't get the paper in. I now have to replace this "new" printer. That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted.
__label__1 yes total waste of money: This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity. I haven't written many reviews before, but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers. Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare. Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine. Anyone see office space? yeah after I get my new Canon printer, i will re-enact that scene. perhaps i should record it and send it to HP?
__label__1 DO NOT PURCHASE: I have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers, but this product has been horribly implemented. I have continually had issues with attempting to install the 160+ MB driver and HP Solution Center software on multiple different computers running different Operating Systems. The scanner is about worn out, as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase. HP used to be known for their great quality in printers, but this is unfortunately no longer the case. Do Not Buy.
__label__1 Paper jams, bloated driver, shutdowns: To begin, the software installation is a headache. I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT. Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing. While I think HP business grade printers are great, this consumer grade printer is junk.
__label__1 Yes, the paper does not feed correctly!: I am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems. The printer was fine at first although difficult to set up (software). Now, a month later, the printer either doesn't take the paper or jams. It has nothing to do with the quality of the paper. I am also surprised that this wasn't discovered in testing. I also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller. What a rip off. I have had it with HP printers. I will never buy another.
__label__1 Who Framed Roger Rabbit: I bought this movie new, but it will not play on my DvD player. I have tried several other players/machine to play this in & it will not work in any of them. I am very disappointed with this product. When I was looking at it on Amazon, it didn't say it was not compatable with any system.
__label__1 no: Why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in The United States? Does it make any sense for you? Why don't ask us to be sure before send it to another Country? If you know that it won't work on that Country?
__label__1 Idk: It doesn't play in normal DVD players. So idk where I could watch it. I was looking forward to watching it.
__label__2 Took My Breath Away: Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little. Maybe it didn't exactly take my breath away, but it is an incredible DVD. This is a real good movie, however "not exactly a phenomenon" as Steven Speilberg claims in a brief interview on the DVD. The DVD in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding. I found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years-worth animation included with the live-action, get it produced, make countless sketches, and finally get it out to the theaters. Well done. Very well done. I couldn't be more pleased and more impressed with this special DVD release. It's definitely a must-have.
__label__2 Five stars aint nothin'. I'd Give it 10000 If I could: My Grandmother bought this for me when I was 2 years old. I've loved since then. I havent watched it in a while so I decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on T.V. This movie bought back so many memories of when me, my cousins (who I havent spoken to since i was 8) and friends were little. I knew every song and every line. Get this movie. It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids. You wont regret buying this.
__label__2 Hooked on the Brothers!: Super Mario Bros. is a video game movie that is memorable in the way that may surprise you. The witty dialogue and rapport between Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi, respectively, make this film a real treat upon repeated viewings. Although it features a look that may remind people more of Blade Runner than Super Mario Bros., it has the same charm in its set design that other 1990s science-fiction films have, such as Total Recall or Demolition Man. The tone shifts all over the place from light and comedic to dark and frightening, but the sheer inventiveness on display here make Super Mario Bros. worth a watch. Dennis Hopper gives a performance straight out of a David Lynch film in this one. Watch this flick and I guarantee you'll be hooked on the brothers!
__label__1 One of the worst movies ever made!: OK, I'm not going to get into this movie's lack of similarities to the video games;this movie just plain sucks. I can't see why anybody over the age of twelve can enjoy this piece of you know what. Come on, this movie has horrible acting, a dreadfully bad story and "hilariously" unfunny jokes. I think you people who gave this movie five stars really need professional help, 'cause one star is far too generous. I'm not saying all the media incarnations of mario sucked;the cartoons were actually pretty good. But this movie, in my opinion is what caused that chain of cartoons to end.
__label__2 A misunderstood and fun film.: Not much I can say except that this movie is often riffed on for all the wrong reasons.Yes, the movie is indeed flawed in many respects. But at the same time, it has a lot of great set pieces, music, good dialogue, good CG and animatronics, and a a scene using Joe Satroni music.It's just a fun movie, worth riffing on if you hate it, but a fun movie if you appreciate it for exactly what it is supposed to be, a fun ride.
__label__1 Could have been better!: I am a big fan of the Super Mario Brothers - the video game and the TV show. I had high hope for this movie, but boy what a waste of time this was. This movie sure give the Super Mario Brothers a bad name. If you haven't seen this movie, I envy you. Nothing like the game of the show. It NEVER should have been made; period.
__label__2 good, Its GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!(Jim Carrey voice): I saw this movie way back when it came out in the theaters but that was so long ago so when I seen it on Amazon I had to get it to see if it was as good as i remember it and it was better. I tell you it is hard to even take it from the player. I think it's really good. Dennis Hopper does a great job as Koopa and the Mario Bros. are great. And for those of you who might think that the princess's name should be Peach not Daisy you are a little off the page. The character of Daisy first shows up in Super Mario Land as Luigi's girl while Peach is Mario's. DUH!!
__label__1 flawed concept: Here's my problem: While I do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life, I don't think every single situation in life is one of our own creation. To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our "thought vibrations" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete "how to" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book. I know the author was going for simplicity, but I found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful.
__label__2 Pity the Fool who Don't Buy This: The best part about the A-Team (besides no one getting hurt, the homemade weapons, the Team member's personalities, and the bad badguys) was the music. From the intro, to Face srenading his girl-du-jour, or Murdock talking to his invisible dog, to B.A. helping out at the Youth Center, to the raging firefights and homemade weapons, to the end credits, the music in A-Team was always appropriate for the setting, and always good. I love it when a soundtrack comes together!
__label__1 Rosemary's Baby: This dvd came from England & would not play on my player so I have returned it & I am waiting on a credit. I would not have ordered this had I know it was coming from England & that I might have a problem
__label__2 I loved everything about this movie: The acting is fantastic. Direction outstanding. Chilling in every sense of the word. I love this movie! One of my top ten.
__label__2 A Face Only A Mother Could Love !!: Yes, Devil Conspiracy at it's finest..this is a true 1960ish classic and another epic from Roman Polanski.How the lifestyle of Doris Day becomes satanic..This Devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid 1960's coming as it did with the saga of Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and Polanski somehow tied into all of this.Nonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness, Lucifer, evil with the premise of the birth of the antichrist.Rosemary herself (a witch not by choice), battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win.... This movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of Rosemary.A truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil, passion and reason, a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future stars.The extras are good.
__label__2 Michael sings the classics: These are the best-known "hits" from the best-loved shows -- the songs you go home humming -- and Michael's gorgeous and evocative voice really delivers the goods. Love this tour of great moments on stage.
__label__2 Unbelieveable video and interesting stories: Unlike most of the reviews here, I was able to play this HD DVD without any problems. I use my Xbox 360 to play HD DVDs, which is able to automatically get any updates that are needed.Anyway, the movie follows the stories of multiple Italian people, all of different ages and background, as they embark on different milestones in their lives. The video is full of beautiful shots with great hi-def detail. The narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak English.I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italy. My wife and I went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited.
__label__1 Wish I had read the reviews ...: These videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective, but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the Italy & Austrailia disks. DO NOT BUY until the problem is fixed ... you'll just have to send them back.
__label__1 Disappointed: I only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of Italy and its cities,towns and natural coutryside, particulary in the north, as opposed to horse racing, auto racing etc.
__label__1 FIRMWARE FIXED IT: I just updated to the newest firmware (1.5 4/12/2007) and the disc is now PLAYABLE in my XA2. Big relieve for all I hope. Review of the source to follow.
__label__1 Does not work.: Read the reviews about this disk not working. Figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems. Very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk. Brand new XBox HD DVD player refuses to boot with this.
__label__2 Good CD Player, but third-rate headphones.: This CD player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability. But only four months after I got it, the headphones stopped working (properly). When they do work, they don't work on the left side, and you usually have to play around with it before it does. But still, it's a great system. Nice audio quality, too.
__label__2 Detailed, but not to much.: I was impressed with how Mr. Philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail. When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here. It is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to.
__label__2 A SEA AND SURVIVAL STORY OF EPIC PROPORTIONS: This true story takes place in the early to middle 1800's and its location on Nantucket Island and in the middle of nowhere..asea. You learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found, a grueling and dangerous activity to land it. The ship Essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing Moby Dick. It is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land. A pageturner.
__label__2 Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea: This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America. Philbrick's writing is clear, powerful and incredibly engaging. It's a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it.
__label__2 Inside the Whalers: Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other, and explains each wave along the way. I couldn't put it down. I had a special interest in that my great-great-grandfather was a whaling captain ("Master"), and traveled those waters with my great-grandfather as a toddler on board. My one criticism of the author's perspective is what he didn't critique - cannibalism! I know it is easy to point fingers when I was not there, starving and dying of thirst, but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers, based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends. Why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends? Perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this. Why was that not a significant part of this work?Nevertheless, thank you Nate Philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie, with some of this balance.
__label__2 great historical account of good and bad leadership: a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the Essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that. The failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mate's influence to sail east in the small whaleboats, in spite of his own gut feeling that they should sail west. We may not like some of the decisions they made in order that some of them might have the chance to stay alive, but we until we are in their shoes we cannot be judgmental.great book
__label__2 What a wonderful Story: What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad.
__label__2 In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.: The condition is somewhat less than perfect -- but not much.The book is wonderful. Fascinating story and Very well researched and written.
__label__2 The sinking of the whale ship Essex: This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives, after their rescue, I found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook up.I would recommend this book. It was the chosen book by our Book Club of women and all found it interesting .
__label__2 How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version?: I haven't read this book, but I was wondering how this book stacks up with the Penguin version 'The Loss of the Whale Ship Essex, Sunk By A Whale?' From what I understand, this novel is a retelling of events while the Penguin Classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members? I'm a bit torn as to which one I should read/purchase. All comments are very much appreciated.
__label__2 An Exciting Tale of Survival: The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick, the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction. The author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale. In addition, one will become immeresed in the history of Nantucket, the whaling industry (including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted), and other elements of this particular place and time in history. An exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature, the true survival story. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Poetry with a knack for memorable imagery.: Paul Hoover is an experienced and successful poet having published six earlier books of award winning poetry. Totem And Shadow: New and Selected Poems continues to document his impressive talent wedded to an innate knack for memorable imagery. After Miss Graven's Remarks: Boy, my left eye cries when I see kids/play violins and things. How did they get/so young? And I can't stop my fractures/when they strike toy xylophones in a song/too sentimental, mechanical sugarplum fairies./It's brutal of them t kill me with growing up/like this, and Mrs. Pollen, who tends them,/why is she so kind under her matronly woolens?/What is so appealing in a clumsy, fuzzy/third-grader, ghostly in polyester as any/sad adult? Sure, there's no god to do it,/but they should have bright violent minds/to brace them for a while, and one tough look/keep them when Christmas isn't the mood.
__label__1 Not the real thing: I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product. I guess I got what I paid for since these pills did not work at all. The ingredients list the same as Phazyme but offered no relief.
__label__2 A sports world comedy sporting two wonderful stars: Hepburn and Tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent. An agent who turns out to be a good guy when he finds the right woman in the guise of Hepburn. Hepburn got to display her range of athletic skills in this film alongside some of the great female golfers and men and women tennis stars of the 1950's.Great film.
__label__1 Yuck: I must respectfully disagree with the 5 star rating for this CD. The reason being is that I have never heard such muck up of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons". I have to admit I bought this CD purely for Piazzolla's "4 Seasons" and now I am convinced that I definitely must search for a different performance of it, being almost certain that this one is not doing it justice.
__label__1 Still a Mystery: Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book. This book, in fact, does not examine anything of intellectual, spiritual, or social value as related to Sufism or Islam. I have come across many books written by so-called Sufi Masters, who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery. This is not one of them. While books in this genre easily turn into polemics, this one surely takes the unenlightened cake. The stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an 'easy way out' of organizing a coherent book of ideology.
__label__2 Great book: Very good book. Quick read, good story and beautiful illustrations. Got this for myself to read, but am going to have my 9yr old read it as well.
__label__2 Works great! love it!: I was able to easily search for a wireless network and set up my Tivo to my wireless internet! Works flawlessly!
__label__2 TiVo wireless adapter: If you can't connect your TiVo using an Ethernet cord then this is the next best thing. This is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a TiVo. This adapter was specifically design for TiVo.
__label__2 Tivo Wireless Adapter: Making Tivo apart of my wireless network was easy to do and now I can watch what is on either Tivo no matter which room I am in.
__label__2 Great Buy: Bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted. Worked right out of the box. Very good product.
__label__2 TiVo wireless adaptor: Quick to ship and arrive, price better than from TiVo. Only annoyance is that TiVo requires a specialized wireless G USB adaptor.
__label__2 Works as it should: Got it, opened it, plugged it in, entered my net info, and Bob's your flippin' Mother's sister's brother!
__label__2 Tivo wireless adapter: Great product, works extremely well. My modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs. I get an 85% signal strength. Highly recommend.
__label__1 not too compatible with iMac: the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network. When Tivo worked on the network, my printer didn't. It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in.
__label__1 wasted my money: I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network. Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
__label__2 Wireless is the way to go!: This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the "setting up" stage of connecting your adapter, you weren't supposed to enter the router's password but rather the complicated encryption key.
__label__2 Works.: Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception, and I couldn't get it to go more than 50-58%. But it still works.
__label__2 It works: This wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my Tivo. I had bought one at Radio Shack of a different brand and it did not work at all. But the TiVo Adapter was easy to plug in and set up. I have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now I don't need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modem/router.
__label__2 Real Plug and Play: Plugged it in and my Series 2 DT popped up a config screen, entered my WPA password and I was good to go. Simple set and good range.
__label__2 It works: Not too much to say about this adapter. It does what it's supposed to. Sure an N adapter would be better but even the G is over priced.
__label__2 Great product!: Easy to setup without having to read the manual (haha) and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems.
__label__2 Works perfectly and a great price.: Short and sweet. Had it working flawlessly for 2 weeks now. No problems at all.
__label__2 Great price and works perfect: I paid less and got the exact same Tivo wireless adapter as sold by Tivo. I have had no problems and now I get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables..
__label__2 Tivo Wirelss G: Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time, especially when one unit is dependant on the other. Unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted. Seems to be OK now.This is my first Tivo and adapter so I have nothing to compare this product with.
__label__2 Works with my Pioneer DVR-810H: I had purchased another wireless network adapter that wouldn't work for my DVR (approx. 4+ yrs old now). This TiVo adapter connected and works great. Saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through Amazon instead of TiVo directly...
__label__1 Died 12/29/09 purchased 3/2007: I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot, while the others are not even warm.
__label__2 Great product and easy to use!: We unpacked this small module, plugged it into the TiVo, followed the on-screen instructions, and we were set up within 15 minutes. We cancelled our landline telephone service, not considering that our TiVo subscription required dial-up access. We ordered this product right away, and it arrived within 3 days, and was simple to set up. So far, no problems!
__label__2 I like Hardy, but I loved the Mayor: I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again.
__label__2 I liked this book.: At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the "evils" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!
__label__1 Dubious creation: There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions.
__label__2 Hard questions....Real Answers: This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends.
__label__1 Snooz-a-pa-looza: Total waste of celluloid, not to mention time, money etc. Not entertaining at all. Not creative at all. Not artistic in the least. Absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative. The viewer gets to accompany someone, who resembles Cobain, for an uneventful, boring walk in the woods and a mission to avoid any contact with anyone else. The only thing that kept me from ejecting the DVD was my faith in ole Gus. I kept saying to myself," this can't be all there is to this film." I kept waiting until even all the credits had rolled, as if there would be some surprise or explanation for wasting all that film. SNORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE!
__label__1 horrible!!!: I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt, and thats it!! It was a def. bummer and I had to pull myself through it!! I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this. If you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted!! All in all take my word for it, this is a waste of money and time!!
__label__1 Worst.movie.ever.: Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen, I never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that I felt obligated to say something......Heres the movie: Guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotgun...treated to a full boyz2men video on a tv...guy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumble...silence and camera focused on a bush for 2 mins...guys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song 2 guys kiss and lay on eachother in bed...guy makes mac and cheese....guy dies in his greenhouse.....awesome movie....makes me want to watch dude wheres my car
__label__1 What a waste!: Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched "The Doors" too many times. What a waste, another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career. I'd recommend buying any album from Nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows.
__label__1 Dissapointed...: I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician). The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt. I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously. Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless. We already know how it's going to end (like with "Elephant") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes. I admire Van Sant's lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero Kurt, but it just falls short in the end.
__label__1 Difficult Read: This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story.
__label__1 An Insult to the English Language: I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust.
__label__1 Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.: The back cover states "Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's.
__label__1 Great for Novices who want to stay that way: Elaine and Peter are career authors. They obviously don't use the products they write about, and this book is no exception. It is lacking in common sense, good advice, and practical tips and techniques. This series tends to be quite good overall, but the authors' obvious unfamiliarity with the product they are writing about shines through vividly.If that weren't bad enough, many of the examples are poor quality and look bitmapped! In a vector book! Shame!
__label__1 Expected more...: not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent, but artistically ... wrong managed. Stopped watching after 30 min.
__label__2 High Energy Performance: These women ROCK! This is a wonderful performance by 4 very talented string musicians. It is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing, or at the least, tapping your feet. I enjoy watching it while I'm cooking--really gets me in a festive mood. Highly recommend it if you enjoy up-tempo, contemporary music.
__label__2 Didn't quite live up to expectations, but still enjoyable: As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual "entertaining". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it.
__label__1 Useless for Home theatre or TV show.: This product is good for UK only. To play in USA you need to find a DVD player which has capability for changing Region Code to UK and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on DVD player in USA. I order it in USA, prodact came from Uk and I couldn't play it on my most advanced DVD player.
__label__2 Wonderful Techniques!: I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children, 4 and 2, and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book!
__label__2 Solid overall: Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach, which is a plus on the B Minor Mass. Everything is well articulated, with solid bass lines (often lacking in "authentic" performances). He captures the faith aspect very well. His "crucifixus" is the best I have heard in capturing the pain of the cross, followed by the brilliant contrast of "et resurrexit". He has an excellent cast of soloists. It flows well, but has a very slight feel of heavy-footedness. It has none of the dance quality so prominent in the Mauersberger recording (Rudolf Mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion). Overall, most people who are not too much into "Historically Informed" would find this quite satisfying.
__label__2 Excellent Service: I order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase. It is excatly what I wanted and I got it in no time flat. I was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it..
__label__2 Well made, but runs a little small: Five-star rating for the quality of the product, but they run small. I ordered a large and it was just too small for me. I wear 36" pants comfortably, although I measure 38" around my waist at its thickest point. My thigh is 25" at its thickest point, and I measure 41" around my butt.
__label__1 used to be good: I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago. my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . won't be buying again
__label__1 Wrong size: I have no idea how good or bad this item is. Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it. When it came it was S. and I didn't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size. When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has.
__label__2 Works as Advertised: No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention. Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your "area" may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear. Once you remember to do that, you're set!
__label__1 Dumping it down the drain: This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said "day." I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share.
__label__1 Original poem not used, images were of modern players: There are several altered versions of Thayer's classic poem in existance.This book uses one of them.I love this poem, and I wish the author had stuck with the original.Especially when Ernest Lawrence Thayer is listed as the author!Also- the images of Casey and the spectators are of modernday participants. Casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform. Not like a playerin 1888 at all.Leroy Neiman is a great artist, and that is the only reason I give this2 stars.
__label__1 This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.: Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series.
__label__1 maya: I loved the cover when I saw it, and I was very excited to receive it. I like this artists music, but was not too thrilled with this CD. It was not what I thought it would be, and very "jungle like"
__label__2 A Lesson in Human Tragedy: This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about " a stranger killing my old dog" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!
__label__1 Of Mice and Men! More like Manly Mice!: I found several critical problems with this play, including narrative structure, plot thematics, metaphorical irony, and satirical narcissism. Serious scholars need not apply. The books are not for the people to do with Lenny and Carl. Shooting the tragedy in the end is an unfortunate incident for the lives of everyone on the earthen structures. If you're good looking for Steinbeck, I suggest the "Rapes of Wrath."
__label__2 Read this book!!: I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
__label__2 A Simple Story That Says So Much: Short, but marvelous. That's Of Mice and Men in three words, but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classic.Through this tale, John Steinbeck was able to say so much, in so little words. Never before have I seen so many themes bonded so seemlessly together, without being boring and flat. No, Of Mice and Men was enjoyable, and I would never mind reading it again. I will never forget Of Mice and Men, for it has found its own special place in my heart, and forever there it will remain.
__label__2 Lexi A.W., student of Maces Lane Middle School the best book I have ever read: Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was the best book I have ever read. The characters, the mentally retarded Lennie and the tough George, are on the run from people from Weed. Lennie was accused of trying to rape a girl in a red dress when he actually wanted to touch it since it was so soft. After that, they find a ranch in Salinas, California to work on for a while. There are conflicts and solutions all at the same time.My favorite character was Lennie because even though, he was really mentally retarded, he was kind and did nothing out of harm. He knew that George loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch. All he thought about was the rabbits. "I get to tend the rabbits" was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm. Sometimes, I always thought he was rather hopeful even when he was sad.
__label__2 Of mice and men - Izzy G: Of mice and men was a great book. It told about how and little man named, George who was smart and a dumb man, Lennie who was really big and strong. This book explained how the one man helps out another guy that isnt smart at all and just needs taking caring of because his Aunt Clara died. Well while they both keep working on the fields Bucking Barley, they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres. Well Lennie loves to rub soft things, so he wants to just get the house and tend the rabbits. The book is just a good book of how good of friends can work together and when something goes wrong a friend has to do the thing that is best for the other.
__label__2 Great piece of american literature.: I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
__label__2 Review for Of Mice and Men: Of Mice an Men is a great novel. It sends you back in time to the Great Depression era of the 1930's. It is a good book for middle school students. The reason I gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book. Except for the language, this book is a great book to read.
__label__2 Astonishing! A Masterpiece! Bravo!: By far, one of the best books ever written. I felt as if I was in the book taking part of the adventure. John Steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.The feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book. The story of when George and Lennie will have their own land, and Lennie could finally raise rabbits - just gives you your own sense of liberty.Please, if you are sensitive and/or depressed, be aware. This book is great, but very depressing.
__label__2 "of mice and men " by: Ruben from Tx: "Of Mice and Men"In this story there are two very good friends, George and Lennie. They are on a journey for a better life. Lennie is mentally ill so George teaches him right from wrong on the way. They are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job. Several of Lennie's habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one. Lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what George manages to over look them until Lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a SHOCKING ending.
__label__1 don't read this book: When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch "I'm not saying he's bright, he ain't, but he's as strong as a bull.") but the theme doesn't make it a pleasure to read. The book is easy to understand and doesn't have difficult words. The story is about to people, George and Leenie, who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job. They have a dream but it's very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie's dumbness. When they're working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie. The entire story is about that subject. To finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books (unless you have to read it for school). I could only recommended to Steinbecks fans.
__label__2 Of Mice and Men: My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as Of Mice and Men.
__label__2 Of Mice And Men: The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment. I expected the book to be about mice. I later found out it was really about. This book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake. George is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation. So the book takes place in a rural area in California. I t is a fiction book. It's a rally good book so you should check it out.
__label__2 OF Mice and Men: A classic, as always. In the today world of teaching tolerance and differences, this remains a good one to use in the classroom.
__label__2 Wow: This book is short, but man it packs a touching message. I had to read it for a class and analyze everything about it and it really is a touching story if you put everything together. The ending completely surprised me, and I can see why George decided to do that. It left me crying for both George and Lennie for everything they had been through. I will never forget this book and will continue reading it throughout the years. Lennie may have been dumb but he was still smart in his own special ways.
__label__2 awesome!: this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it's cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end........
__label__1 dont read this book!: My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!
__label__2 You must read this book!: Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George, a small quick guy helps Lennie, a big guy, who is not very smart.Through the story George always helps Lennie.This book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens.My favorite part about Of Mice and Men is that it has a sad ending.It's not one of those boring story's where it has a happy endind.This book is more unique.
__label__2 Winning The Affiliate Game: Using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by. Thanks Declan for providing information that truly helps the average, everyday person become successful in this awesome frontier called the Internet.
__label__1 Lukewarm at Best: I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan, hoping for a more polished, Morrissey-rich experience, but this was a pretty sub-par affair- and frankly it's annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution. Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over-all. Bad editing and annoying Cali pop-punk soundtrack, only saved by the presence of Quasi. I was really disappointed- when people put such little effort and inspiration into something, and they get support, one less person with a real vision gets heard. It was occasionally worth a laugh, but overall I found myself angry at the Gods for opening up the Pandora's box of indie films without keeping the hacks out. We have enough of those in Hollywood.
__label__1 Overrated: The funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it, the rest was lame. I found myself yawning. The only good thing about this book is how small it is, the boredom ends in a couple of hours.
__label__2 Pretty good, but not all new to me: I bought this book when my twins were 9 months old and I wanted some guidance on daytime napping, and a lot of friends had recommended Healthy Sleep Habits... I didn't mean to buy 'Your fussy Baby', since mine are too old for that- so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books. I had already read a lot of books on sleep training, and while there were some really good tips here, I found 'The Contented Little Baby Book' by Gina Ford more direct. Weissbluth allows for more discretion which I think a mother needs, and overall I think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies, and you can adapt what works for your style and babies. A must-read if your baby doesn't sleep very much and you think it is OK that way- it's not!
__label__1 save your money!: As an avid movie goer, this just about changed me to a non movie goer. The lesson I learned was to pay a little attention before dropping your money into a "maybe it might be good because Adam Sandler is in it". movie. Boy was I wrong! This is not even worth renting! Bad,Bad,stupid,poor writing, acting,filming , generally it sucked!
__label__2 Wonderful!! Watch it twice or you are missing out!: The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I remember liking it but being so sad at the end. Nevertheless, as I love Drew and Adam, I bought it on DVD when it came out. I couldn't believe how much I laughed!! Now that I knew the ending, it wasn't so sad that I missed the rest of the movie. There are so many clever scenes in this movie that I think people forget if they just watch it once. When Drew attacks Rob Schneider with a bat! When Adam jokes with his walrus and penguin! When Adam apologizes to Drew for not being better looking! I can go on and on.This is the movie my husband and I put on when we want to laugh and cuddle on the couch on Friday night. It's perfect!
__label__2 Another must-have-DVD from Sandler: I do love Adam Sandler and I thought him and Drew made a great pair in "The Wedding Singer" so I just had to watch this. I was not disappointed. It is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are well-written punch lines.Henry sees Lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him. Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.It turns out to be a charming, romantic and very touching movie. One of the BEST movies in this genre to come out in 2005!
__label__1 Schizophrenic product: At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people, so they added a ton of crude slap-stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual "humor." This robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer's heart, and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room. The earlier movie in which these two co-leads appeared, The Wedding Singer, was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks. 50 First Dates is a movie worth missing.
__label__1 The First Fifty Sandler Movies...: ... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream....
__label__2 alot like life - funny & tragic: I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that, with the terrific on-screen chemistry of Sandler (although I can't stand him in most other films) and Barrymore.
__label__2 Fall in Love for the First Time Everyday!: The idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again. In this story it happens literally everyday.The performances:Adam Sandler as Henry Roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance.Drew Barrymore as Lucy Whitmore has never been better, and has great chemistry with Adam. She emerges as a fine actor.Rob Schneider as Ula may fool you that he is really the character he is playing, I didn't know it was him for half the move! He is brilliantly funny.Sean Astin as Doug Whitmore (better known as Sam from the Lord of the Rings) is funny in this comic role as Lucy's lisping brother.Pomaika'i Brown as Nick (tattoo face) the cook, is great in his small role and deserves bigger roles in the future.Shot in Hawaii, it has beautiful cinematography and vibrant color. The movie is a combination of humor and romance with more heart than you might expect.
__label__1 perfume: This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
__label__1 Stay Away From Passport - Large "PIP" Logo On Screen: Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large "PIP" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality, get the Roan edition.
__label__2 Cookwear 4 qt. 3 piece: I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it, I am sold. Nice size.
__label__2 so did you read the DNA report?: it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place, shiva and shakti seals and so on, she then again go back to the imaginary of how European white Aryan descended to the black Dravidian world of Indus valley. if that is how Westerner try to write history of other cultures, I myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people. The bottom line is this: do not try to defend something that is indefensible. please start writing all the facts in details, and tell us cleary: what happened to the Indus valley culture? did it disappear or continued as the Vedic culture?
__label__2 I like it alot - from an non-latin: I first started listening to Azucar Moreno through a friend in New York a long time ago... This is exciting music, and you don't have to understand Spanish to get into the party feeling of this music... flamenco, latin pop, whatever you want to call it. Every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker... I think Tequila claims this title, but Besame is cool, and Tu Eres Para Mi is Funky Cool, and Hay Que Matar a la Muerte pops with energy.
__label__2 Topper is Tops!: ... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the "poor man's Betty Grable"--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester.
__label__1 No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!: I like baby dolls, but not this one. I love Phoebe and Roxxi, so maybe I would get the big baby versions of those, but no other big Bratz babyz. This doll is not soft, so so much for hugging and cuddling it. It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come! I love both Barbie and Bratz and nothing willchange that!
__label__2 Vanessa's Harmonium: A Work Of Art: Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking."White House", "Who's To Say", "Afterglow", "Private Radio", "Half A Week Before The Winter", and "She Floats" stand out from the rest of the album. Each one reveals Vanessa's look on life from the past, present, and future. They also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could be.The rest of Harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well, for they tell stories which are ear catching. This album is not what I expected it to be after hearing her debut one; Harmonium is a work of art.
__label__2 Amazing CD!!!: This is by far a better CD than Vanessa's first. All I have to say is that this is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. "Whos to Say" has become one of my favorite songs. "San Francisco" is also an amazing song. Vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album.
__label__2 Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton: Harmonium is such an incredible record, and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for Vanessa Carlton's sophomore album. It is a little different from 2002's Be Not Nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into Vanessa's beautiful, and sometimes dark, soul. I would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs. Some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet White Houses, a summer song about friendship, love, and loss, and Who's to Say, a song about choosing between family and a relationhip. Also, though a little dark, Annie shines on Harmonium. If you are not already a Nessaholic, you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift. Harmonium is in stores now, so go out and pick it up now!
__label__2 So much fun and versatile: My daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece, a must for any Naruto fan to add to their collection!
__label__2 perfect: fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
__label__1 BAD!! Don't buy IT: This item doesn't even look like the one the picture... It's not the real thing and it's a bootleg one..
__label__2 A very informative book: I expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through. This book,however, was extremely interesting,informative and easy to read. It is the sort of book that the normal man in the street could read and apply as easily as someone who is more knowledgeable about the subject. A wonderful handbook for anyone having troubles of this nature and a wothwhile read for any safety conscious individual..
__label__2 Plenty of Emotion: I don't agree that Clay shows no emotion. One needs only to listen to "The Way", "Measure of a Man", "Run to Me" ... or music from the AI season - "Solitaire", "Here, There and Every Where" to hear plenty of emotion and inflection. Let's not forget "Silver Bells" and "Give a little love this Chrismas" (forgive me if I got the title wrong). Hopefully some of you have had a chance to listen to some of his demo music with many spiritual songs and one song that brought me to tears "I Will Be There". Not only can this artist belt it out - he can also whisper softly and pull you right into the song. But I digress, as for my review of this CD, the problem is not the singer or the voice of the singer, but the weakness of the songs and their production. Hopefully, they will take more time with Clay's next CD and bring music to the table that matches his talent. I recommend the CD on the strength of Clay's voice and the way it makes you feel even the weaker songs.
__label__2 Awesome: Listened to the CD three times and love it. Catchy tunes I caught myself humming throughout the day. Love ballads that I so moving. Great mix of songs. It sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today. A few tunes were almost Beatles sounding. Clean and refreshing!!! Clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it. Anyone who wants an enjoyble CD that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this CD. The CD just makes you feel good. Clay sounds great.
__label__2 Hot! Hot! Hot!! This Man Is a Superstar In the Making!: I cannot describe the wonderful voice of this young man. Its so awesome, he takes my breath away. I recommend this cd to everyone. He shows such emotion and love with each note he sings. Thank you Clay Aiken for this magnificent cd and I so look forward to your tour and your next cd.
__label__1 Why won't amazon post my review: I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's "Measure of a Man" does not measure up to Reuben's "Soulful".
__label__1 Yawn.....: Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough, but his music is just so corny and boring. All ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs. I can't even bear to listen. I only do it to figure out what all the furor is about. I still haven't. Save yourself the effort.
__label__1 schmalz: In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define "schmalz". Oh my god, is this what our music culture has devolved to?. This album was inflicted on me as I was in Border's the other day. I left without buying anything, which is unusual for me. By the way, cats are wonderful creatures.
__label__2 If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD: Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.
__label__1 Talent without good songs.: It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However, the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that Clay Aiken holds. Every song on this album sounds the same. The emotions portrayed by Clay are not very diverse; every emotion fits into either the category of "I am singing about pain" or "We are going to get through the pain". The truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to. The only song on this less-than-quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track, "Measure Of A Man." This song is in a realm of its own, actually having a worthwhile message.In summation, the talent is there, the album is not. Maybe next time, Clay.
__label__1 california: I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail.
__label__2 He is the Measure of a man.: I love this man...and please don't get me started on his voice!I now can't ever imagine my life without having Clay Aiken in it! He's such a wonderful talent...not only with his beautiful, haunting vibrato, but his whole persona.He is the next Elvis, I can't wait to hear many more albums to come! Believe me I'm a picky person when it comes to music I chose...and I chose Clay!Measure of a man gets an A++++, thumbs up and a million stars.
__label__2 good but could be great: First, I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken. He has a magnificent voice that I feel the "powers that be" tried to turn into just another pop singer. I'm not saying the songs are bad, I'm just saying some of them weren't easily recognized as Clay's voice. I would have loved more ballads with the backgrounds a little quieter so Clay could shine through. Let's hope the next album has more of Clay, less pop attitude.
__label__1 Measure of a Man's bad Material: Don't get me wrong, Clay is a wonderful vocalist. Really, truely, he is a gifted singer. But the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible, stale, and downright creepy material. Has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to "Invisible"? It sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman, and it's way creepy. His other songs all sound the same, and in some cases are laughably silly. I feel so let down. I wanted so much to love this album, because I love Clay, but it's just bad. Hopefully next time around Clay gets himself more worthy material, because if he continues down this path, he will end up forgotten. Please! Better material!
__label__1 marketing machine-wolf wearing sheep skin: Ok people. I like POP music, I do. I like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial. This CD is no different than Pink or Britney CD's as Mr. Clay is claiming to be, different that is. He said people are tired of fake pop stars. Well to tell you the truth, he is no different. It is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you, ordinary and all nice, so you could buy his CD. Well that don't matter too much to me if the music is good, but this CD ain't nothing special. Ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics. I also have message for Clay: Kid, good job with stories about how you're so different than Justin and Pink. American public eats them for lunch, and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks!!!
__label__1 Great voice, lousy material: This album is a MAJOR disappointment because Clay Aiken has so much promise as an entertainer. His charisma and talent, so evident on American Idol, are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs. The title alone was a bad choice - Kevin Sharp also released a "Measure of a Man" in the 90s (and was much more deserving to use it, since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording) and this collection of forgettable tracks won't give Clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world. Please, American Idol - you got them through the door, but that means nothing if they can't stay there. Bad album from a bright talent.
__label__1 Great Singer, Wrong Material: The Clive Davis churned out anothere same ol', same ol'...like what David Foster did to Josh Groban....great voices with little to do. The singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong...oh, well....I will hope for better next time!
__label__2 Changed my life: These recordings deeply affected me- even more so than the works of the Johnny Mathis.
__label__2 5 stars for the voice, 3 for the songs: I would expect no less than great singing, and Clay doesn't disappoint. His voice is just gorgeous. His singing, delivery and the CD's production are all terrific.My one complaint has more to do with music today than with Clay: Can't anyone write a good, up-tempo melody these days?? Some of these songs are just boring. But then again, I find that to be the case with most of what's on the radio nowadays. (Everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid.) My favorite Clay moments from American Idol were when he sang faster songs - Billy Joel, Grease, Buttercup - so I know he can definitely sing uptempo songs. I just hope he does on the next album!
__label__2 CLAY FAN: CLAY AIKENS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECITED HIS VOICE LIFT'S MY SPIRIT'S UP I AM A DIE HEART ELVIS FAN JUST WATING FOR SOME ONE TO LIKE AS MUCH I THINK I HAVE FOUND HIM
__label__2 I Love It.: When I first listened to "The Way" I loved it instantly. It's the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time. It is very catchy and very romantic. I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry, for going off there. Anyway, I love "The Way" and I also really really like "Touch". Overall, I love the entire CD. I am going to play it until I memorize every word.
__label__1 I'm sorry: I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was "cute". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because you can't give a CD zero stars, if I could give it zero stars I would.
__label__1 Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony.....: Ugh! From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover, this guy screams superficiality! Sorry, Clay....you might have been second in American Idol II...but you are NOT Barry Manilow! I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom. It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public. So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this. Please, spend your money wisely and don't buy this CD. Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead. At least those folks worked for years to get where they are...and obviously have some talent. Clay, I wish you luck...but I am sure your career will be history in about a year.
__label__2 Measure Of A Man CD Is The Best: Don't listen to that negative, uncalled-for review by F.Faulkner "F.F." He doesn't know what he is talking about. He just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous, rude, and ignorant. Let me clean up this board. Clay Aiken's voice is outstanding and is like no other. "Measure Of A Man" CD is exciting and is the best debut CD by a male musical artist in the past 3 years. Clay Aiken is "America's Idol" because of his irresistable voice and character and his many, many fans. Please buy this CD. You will not be disappointed at all. The songs are very good.
__label__2 The Real American Idol: This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks. A must have for all American Idol fans, but this CD is appealing to everyone! 90% of these songs are great. I wish Solitaire would have been included, but it will be on his next single. Finally, a singer with TALENT!
__label__2 Superb!: Clay Aiken's debut... I wasn't sure what to think, I tried to stay away from American Idol records but when I heard "Invisible" on the radio, my resolve melted and I purchased the cd... and I'm very glad I did :).Clay has a beautiful/powerful voice... unlike some artists out there, he's truly talented. He puts his heart and soul into each and every song... There isn't one song on this that I hate.Once he draws you in, you won't let go :).No offense to Ruben fans, but I believe Clay should've won the contest.I couldn't recommend this CD any higher, I believe Clay will be around for a long time to come :).
__label__2 CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI: THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
__label__1 Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!: Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even "Solitaire" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!
__label__2 YAY: I fell in love with Clay's voice when he sang Open Arms on American Idol. It was so touching, and I never understood whynone of my friends liked him (they liked ruben instead). Nobody thought Clay would ever make it far, and look at him now. He has the BEST VOICE and his CD is AWESOME! I highly reccomend the songs Invisible, The Way, When You Say You Love Me, and This is the night. I especially like When You Say You Love Me because Clay is not as good at uptempo songs, but he nailed this one. I program my CD player to play this song over and over. All of the songs on this CD are awesome and I know you'll love it.
__label__2 EXCELLENT!!!!!! 5 stars plus!!!!: Excellent voice, excellent lyrics, excellent music... This cd has is all. Every track on this cd shows Clay Aiken's pure and natural talent. This cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date, Oct 14, I listen to it everyday. Finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent, there is a young man that has talent, a gift to us all, a truly beautiful voice. Clay fills the void of what is missing in today's music, A REAL SINGER, and he does it so well.Its a shame that I could only give it 5 stars because its so much better than that. Clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time.
__label__2 Well Done: I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform "Invisible" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well.
__label__2 amazing!: Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing, I was a fan. I voted for him when he was on American Idol (a lot more then once, let me tell you) and now I am even obsessed with him. I was so excited when Clay's album came out. I love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost. There have been a lot of bad reviews and I am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion. But, I really don't know what they are talking about. Maybe they are listening to a different CD or something, because this album is amazing. His voice could have been showed off more, but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in Perfect Day. I think a lot of people would love this CD!
__label__1 nothing out of the ordinary: This man really does have a great voice, don't get me wrong... but I don't think this is an album that people should waste there money on.Yes, I am a fan of Josh Groban but this is not what the deal is about. I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics. I mean 'Invisible' is about Clay wanting to watch me in my room. That kind of freaks me out. I don't want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed.Clay got on American Idol to become the famous person that he is. If it wasn't for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher. He has a normal voice. Nothing that someone in a church choir doesn't have.I think that if you are going to blow your money on real music, then you should buy Josh Groban. Yea, he does sing in different languages, but if you translate them they have great meanings. And you can even get addicted to Italian. At least Josh can speak another language. heh.
__label__1 When a good voice meets bad music: This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice.
__label__2 Listen to it again!: Being a 31-year old male, I am probably not the typical Clay Aiken fan. As with many, the first time I heard the album I was disappointed...very disappointed. After I listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me. Now, I think its actually very well done, and Clay's vocals on the album are absolutely incredible.For those who were unimpressed with the album, I encourage you to listen to it again...maybe even twice. If you still don't like it, fine - shelf it...but I think you'll find it will grow on you.It seems a lot of people had a similar experience....the more they listened, the more they liked it. I have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two later.So....listen to it again!
__label__1 It hurts: It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
__label__2 Eventually Measures Up ...: While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American "Can Do" philosophy, and a decent human being to boot - I was disappointed when I first listened. Other than "This is the Night," the only track to wow me was "I Survived You." But, since I wanted to love it, and I had paid good money for the thing, I kept listening ... Then I fell - and I mean HARD! ... I DO love this CD ... No, it is not the greatest musical production ever (in fact, I think it is OVERproduced ... Clay's voice sings for itself - it needs less help, not more); but it is a fine start to a career that will cross many medias - (I would love to see Aiken on Broadway, Mr. Cowell!) and we will watch with wonder at the good this great man will do with his life and his time of fame. He is a performer worth supporting and encouraging ... You go Clay!
__label__2 Fresh Sound: Clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode! I think this new release is great in every aspect. I too would like to see Neil Sedaka produce him! That aside, the critics who tell us we can't like him are pushing us right into his "arms".
__label__1 Not a five star rating: I am very surprised at the 5 starspeople are giving this CD. Pleasedon't waste your money. Clay wasokay on AI2 but this new CD justshowcase his talents. Hopefullynext one will be better. I will haveto give this one two thumbs down!
__label__1 Disappointed but still a fan.: Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD.
__label__1 Really bad :(: That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
__label__1 Doesn't Measure Up!: This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice, and this CD does little to show off his true talent. The songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off Clay's gift. I've read many reviews of this CD and the most recent stated the same. It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD's. Good luck next time Clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice.
__label__1 Nice guy and great voice: but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
__label__1 Not What I Expected!!: I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - "Measure of A Man" and "This is the Night". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on "American Idol" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such.
__label__2 CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST: I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out, I had been waiting for it for so long and I was not disappointed at all. He sounds wonderful and it feels as if he's singing only to you. If you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it, this CD is for you!! There aren't many good singers left so I'm thankful he's blessed with this gift.
__label__1 Why I Hate Potato Chips: Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a "reality" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos, Classic rock like Floyd or Zepplin, even modern music like Dream Theater and Nightwish...there is something wrong with American Society.Just like with Potato Chips...you don't know when the frell to stop!
__label__2 Decent Tunes.: I'm not really into pop music. I really like rap and R&B, but I can really dig a great voice. So what can I say? Clay Aiken got a real good voice, soul, power, and range. The songs are a bit predictable and not very challenging, but the dude Aiken racks up all the songs. Touch is a good song, proving that Aiken should explore hip hop a little. When You Say You Love Me has a country sound to it. I DO NOT LIKE country music. I didn't like this song either, but it got itself on in my head for hours. I did like Invincible. Clay can really shake it up. He displays his impressive range in Run To Me and Measure of Man. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rock edge. The Way and Shine and Run To Me are soulful ballads. I liked Aiken's voice better than the songs. Hopefully, he picks some better song writers next time.
__label__2 Clay is da bomb: This CD showcases Clay's talent beautifully!!! He sounds fantastic. I think his music will appeal to a wide range of people. I am very PROUD of Clay Aiken. He has stayed true to himself. Thats refreshing. Way to go Clay!!!
__label__2 Amazing: This is an AMAZING CD! This mans voice is incredable. There is not one song that I dislike. I loved his performances on American Idol, but this CD shows more of what he can do. All you Clay fans are in for something GREAT! Can't say much more, buy it and see for yourself.
__label__2 It Is All About The Voice!!!!!: Clay Aiken's voice stands out more than any other singer I have listened to. It inspires, makes you feel good, excites and is just nice to listen to. I can put his 'Measure Of A Man' CD and listen to EVERY song again, again. Very rare for albums now a days, to have every song enjoyable.1. Invisible - Up tempo pop; catchy and very enjoyable.2. I Will Carry You - Emotional, make you feel good ballad.3. The Way - Again, emotional, make you feel good ballad.4. When You Say You Love Me - Easy listening, country ballad.5. No More Sad Songs - Good ballad, great main chorus.6. Run To Me - Strong ballad.7. Shine - nice listening ballad, Clay sounds very caring.8. I Survived You - Strong ballad.9. This Is The Night - His trademark, awesome ballad.10. Perfect Day - Up tempo ballad, very good.11. Measure Of A Man - Powerful ballad, very emotional.12. Touch - Up tempo, very good.A must have CD. I cannot wait until his next CD.
__label__2 Measure Of A Man: I love, love, love this CD very much!!! Clay Aiken's vocals are perfect and sings so well! Clay Aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay.
__label__2 skydivergirl: LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have listened to this CD since it came out on 10/14/03---CLAY AIKEN has a magical voice that pulls you in. All the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are "The Way", "Touch" and "When You Say You Love ME"....It is refreshing for an entertainer to have the morals and committments that Clay Aiken has!! I find myself singing along to the music--not that you want to hear me singing. God Bless Mr. Aiken in his future endeavors!! I for one have been thrilled with the music and will continue buying anything Mr. Aiken's releases. Go CLAY!!!!! Don't let the nasties get you down...there are a lot of fans that just want to hear you sing!!!!!!
__label__2 CLAY YOU HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT...I LOVED YOUR ALBUM !!!: I am extremely proud of you, Clay...Your album is everything I expected and more !!! I was very impressed with your songs and "always" with your amazing and beautiful voice. God has truly blessed you with a gift and a beautiful soul !!! I am proud to shout to the world "I am a Clay Aiken's Fan...and he is my American Idol". Keep up your good work, in all that you do.You are an AMAZING person. I look forward to ALL of your albums.
__label__1 Doesn't do it.: I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money.
__label__1 Yawner: My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD, and told me I could keep it. I should have been suspicious of this unexpected generosity...My hunch was right on... Every song sounds the same, stale, corny and sleep-inducing. I'd rather re-read month-old newspapers-unless I have trouble sleeping, then I'll whip out the CD and I know I'll fall asleep within 2 songs, or faster.
__label__2 Clay Shines: I wasn't sure how I would react to this CD. It's not the usual style of music I listen to, but I love Clay Aiken's voice. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD rocks! My favorite song is Shine. I can't get it out of my head. I also love Measure of A Man and I Survived You. Yay Clay!
__label__2 Let the Revolution Begin...: After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single, "This is the Night", the expectations were high for his debut album. Luckily, Aiken does not disappoint. From the catchy, up-tempo single "Invisible" to the touching and emotive title track, "Measure of a Man", this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range. While some think his powerful voice is better suited for Broadway, this impeccable debut cd proves that Clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist. In an industry full of sell-outs and talentless clones, it's refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as Clay Aiken.
__label__2 One of the best albums ever!: Since the moment I heard Clay on American Idol 2 I have loved his voice. This album shows just what this youg man can do, he can SING! The songs are powerful and sung to perfection by Clay. Every song is really great, and you will definitely listen to this album over and over. I don't see how anyone could not like it, it's just that good. This is one of the greatest, if not the grestest pop album of all time, Clay made a masterpiece!
__label__2 Excellent CD with catchy songs: This CD is one of very few that I own that I listen to the entire CD. I enjoy each song on the album, and I find myself constantly singing along. I highly recommend this CD.
__label__2 Award winner and very deserving of it: No wonder this man won an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, and his single and album went platinum and double platinum! I bought this CD because I liked Invisible, because of Billboard saying it's the best pop CD of 2003, and because I figured he must be good if he won awards. I was so glad I bought it after I heard it! What a great album! It's so nice to hear someone with a great voice singing material that's not filled with the nonsense that is on so many CDs today. This is real music!
__label__1 Not Thrilled: I watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on American Idol, and waited for this CD to be released.I took it home, played it once and it is now in the stack to be traded in.How disappionting. Maybe I expected too much. I do not like the songs. Sorry.
__label__1 This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!: Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music, and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to TORTURE them!! Way too sappy, way too bland. This is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually. Clay Aiken should stop covering songs from The Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. He's destroying those classics with his "broadwayesque" voice. The Beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative. Clay is nothing like that. Just another talentless popstar getting his 15 minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion. The sooner the better!!!
__label__1 If I could have given this CD a zero...: I'm not a hard person to please, but this CD makes me want to vomit. If you are looking for 12 songs that sound the same, then this is your CD. If you're looking for something with a little variety, look elsewhere. I am a huge fan of Clay's, but was very disappointed with this CD. If you've heard one of the songs, you've pretty much heard them all.
__label__1 Not worth Buying: This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
__label__2 Clay should have won AI: Clay Aiken is the reason I enjoyed the second season of AI so much. His voice is so pure and strong. It's almost like listening to an angel sing. It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings, he does an outstanding job. I bought his album and I have to say I think its the best FIRST album of any american idol thus far. Any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me. Anybody that doesn't think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked. He is Spectacular! In my opinion Clay should have won AI..hands down! Definitely an album worth owning.
__label__1 This album is not as good as they make it seem: Only Claymates like it and his fans are buying his way. Mr. Aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great, however, they have to beg radio to play it. Here is a response from a radio station:QUOTE: "As of right now, we have no plans to add "Invisible" to our playlist.Interest in the song is strictly limited to fans of Clay Aiken.People outside the "Claymate" realm really aren't that into the song.The video isn't even getting substantial play on MTV or VH-1.You may want to try our sister station.The song has more of an Adult Contemporary feel to it.Good luck!" END OF QUOTEDon't believe all the five star reviews of this album, if you want true reviews of this album read the 3 to 1 star reviews and you will get a fair assessment of what it really is about. The other reviews are all hype with no substance.
__label__2 What a cutie!: When I think of Clay, the first phrase that comes to mind is "Awwwwwww..." He is just so cute! And, for once, he's a cutie who can actually sing(!!!) His voice is tremendous, and his songs showcase his voice well. I was a faithful Idol 2 viewer, and rooted for Clay from Day 1. I am delighted to see how much he has grown as an artist (Ruben who?), and how he has overpowered all of the other Idols in popularity, album sales, and TV appearances.My only complaint is the lack of song variety. There's a point where all of the songs start to sound the same, and the only reason that you keep on listening is because, well, it's Clay!He's my favorite Idol!
__label__2 THE MUSIC IS BACK !!: People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the "Measure of a Man" CD. The crystal clearness, unspoiled beauty, perfect pitch, and power of Clay Aiken's voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase. I am so impressed with this CD and, as much as I love each song, I'm blown away by "Perfect Day".
__label__2 Great album: This is an album that I will listen to again and again. Wonderful songs sung by a great voice. "Touch", "I Will Carry You" and "Invisible" are my faves. Pop music at its best!
__label__2 Awesome-Again!: Clay, once again suprises me..I have listened to this CD thinking how could he be better--he is! Clay's voice, range, his use of his God given talent is astounding. All the songs are wonderful especially Invisible and Measure of a Man! He gets better and better and I hope he has a long wonderful journey ahead. I would recommend this CD to everyone. What a great addition to every music library.
__label__1 Whats going on??: I dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it. I dont know i dont have his cd and I'm not going to get it you can if you want to but I like things that are original
__label__2 Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY: This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert, and hear more songs from this amazing young man. He thrills all ages..What an amazing ambassador you have..Clay is also OUR American Idol in CANADA as well..Please come here on your concert tour too
__label__2 Blown Away!: This is truly the best CD that I have bought in a very long time. I followed Clay Aiken all through AI2, loved the first single, was a little worried about the debut CD! I was so "blown away" by the songs, his voice, and the fact that his character comes through every song. What an incredible way to start a career! I am anxiously awating the next CD that he puts out. Thanks Clay, you have shown us that singing is still alive!
__label__2 Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up: Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD, particularly on songs like "Touch" and "Run to Me" and "Invisible", which could otherwise be categorized as ho-hum pop music, if Clay wasn't singing them. The lyrics are a little corny, but Clay makes them sound sincere. The vocal range of most of these songs is not very great, and thus they don't properly show off Clay's unique tenor to-die-for voice.I wish that the "experts" who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum, and left the songs pure, instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds. I can hear that on any modern day pop album, and it is not very special. On the other hand, I can only hear Clay's voice on a few CD's. And his true voice is great enough that it shouldn't be crowded by synthesizer warble.
__label__1 Big disappointment!!!: Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand.
__label__1 AWESOME!!!: I fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on AI. He is not only adorable he as a AWESOME voice!! girls are crazy over him!! and this CD is SOO GREAT!!IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE CLAY SOO MUCH and if u say that you can't stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him??JELOUSY!!! : )Keep it up claymates! he has already gone double platinum!!! WOOWOO!
__label__1 clay is such a joke: he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad.
__label__2 Love It!: I just love this cd. After I got the cd I must have played it over and over for days. There is not a song that isn't great! Everything is sung with such heart! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time. No gimmicks, just pure talent!
__label__2 The Best CD I Have Ever Heard: This CD sent chills down my spine. Clay Aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
__label__1 Teen Titan Tower falls apart: This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!
__label__1 OK Toy: I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys.
__label__2 Good stuff!: I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin, let it sit overnight covered with a bandage, and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning. Is this the placebo effect in action? Perhaps, but I don't see the harm in using it if this is the case. At least it seems to help.
__label__1 Not worth it: Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it.
__label__1 Car Parts (struts) for [] Java []...: This book is a complete waste of time. I had been very skeptical of the technology being only a short-cut for Java web hacks and script-kittys, and I was unfortunately right. Those that can explain how JSP cannot TRUELY conform to the MVC methodology, should really read this book. It would serve them right reading this boring drivel instead of actually learning the core J2EE web framework. Ted Husted should be beaten with this book or an actual car strut.I love most of tools that come out of the Jakarta project but here is a suggestion, learn and know each of the tools suggested for MVC impletementations and skip the gimmic tools, like STRUTS, TURBINE, and VELOCITY. In the event you do buy this book, please consider it's many other uses.I know for me, it has been instrumental for leveling my air conditioner.
__label__1 non working battery: The watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead. I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch. I wont order from this vendow again.
__label__2 Don`t listen to the review...: This album jams! Yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno-pop JAM!
__label__1 Works fine, but expensive: The filter works fine, and I was about to order another. I paid $5.75 for it 7 months ago, and now it is almost $30. I mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on, but more than 5 times as much?
__label__1 Special Waste of Time: This movie is for you if -(a.) you are over 20 and still read comic books(b.) believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman(c.) then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise(d.) find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves(e.) and don't know that, unless distorted, the reality of such individuals is too mundane for a movie(f.) and that some cheaply made movies are not made to convey an altruistic message but to make money.
__label__2 Hystericly Funny: Thought this film was very funny, well done. Acting was great, directing was gritty, but worked well for this movie, and it's story.Would highly recommend if you like dark comedies.
__label__2 Better than I thought: I would consider myself a "radio" Damn Yankees fan, having only heard their radio hits like, "Don't Tread on Me," and, "High Enough." After hearing this Essentials CD though, I see that there's more than meet's the ear. The only song on here that I can't seem to get into is, "Come Again," but all the others are real rockers for me. From the milder, "Silent is Broken," to the fast and heavy, "Piledriver," this CD never stops! The guitars, vocals, bass, and drums, all rock. I tend to give conservative ratings, so that's why I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, but otherwise, I would highly recommend it for any other "radio" fans like myself.
__label__1 Do not be deceived!: This version of "Beowulf" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of "Beowulf". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the "Beowulf" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original "Beowulf" with the mythological Viking god "Odin". The original "Beowulf" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof.
__label__2 creative action all over: this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior. he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil. he uses that knowlage to kill monsters. The book is a little confusing at times, but everything elese is very creative and understandable. I would sugjest this book to 11 year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense. it is only 94 pages, a good lengh for a bed-side book. by the way-beowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover :)
__label__2 Chaka's Powerhouse Vocals!: When this Lp came out in 1982, a Billboard ad stated 'The Most Powerful Instrument in Music Returns'....and it did! This Chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use Power Vocals correctly! I think this Lp was ahead of it's time...a Great fusion of R&B;, Funk & Jazz..Arif Mardin KNEW what to do with Khan's voice! 8 powerful examples of why Chaka Khan is one of the Greatest Singers ever!!I have this on vinyl & CD!!! :)
__label__1 Huxley it ain't...: I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment.
__label__1 Through the Madness!!!: First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like "all the others." Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!
__label__2 works!: I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day, but they seem to work best when you do. The price is better then some of the other products on the market also.
__label__2 Even Creepier Than You Thought: What's most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison. Only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that "these babies deserve to live." Sadly, the interviewer just lets the survivors ramble, when most seem quite willing to answer tough follow up questions. It needed at least another hour.
__label__2 BUEN PRODUCTO: Esta excelente el producto, es tal como lo esperaba.. y bueno por supuesto el servicio de entrega fue inmediato.
__label__1 Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman: If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as "Teach Yourself Hindi" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice.
__label__2 Yancey has another one: I have read all Philip Yancey books & he gives an intellegent & amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the Bible. This provides a person the detailed readings therein, its relationship to everyday life experiences .... all is in proper perspective. It's also an excellent tool for Bible Study. I have it in printed book form & also on my E-Reader.Don't leave home without it.
__label__2 The Paradise War book: I was very pleased at how quickly I received my purchase. It was for a gift and I tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
__label__1 Good show but TERRIBLE packaging: The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that, but I do want to warn you that the DVD case is really cheap, with the DVDs doubled up in the same slot. For the sake of 10 cents cost to them, they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your DVDs.
__label__2 The Sanctuary: I like this show. But then again I like Sy-fi. Amanda Tapping is a good actress. Enjoyed her in StarGate SG1. And in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation..
__label__1 Sanctuary Season 2.....Fail: After enjoying the first series of sanctuary I have recently purchased the second season, Looking forward to the continuation of some good story lines I have been incredibly let down. The first season had some 'shoddy' effects but somehow they have deteriorated into something even worse, there is very poor interaction between animations and cast. I could perhaps forgive this if there was something else good about the series, unfortunately they have really destroyed what was a good series, I have watched 4 episodes and am unsure I will watch any more, the acting is poor, the storyline is worse, the new characters are uninspired and I have no motivation to watch any more as its definitely not getting any better. If you enjoyed the first series you are better off leaving it there and not ruining the series by watching this series. You have been warned.
__label__1 Temperature displayed is incorrect: The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. I returned the thermometer for an exchange from Amazon. The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it, still it shows wrong temperature. I liked ease of mounting on the window and size, but completely useless as fas as what value it shows for the temperature.
__label__2 Olives, Sheep, and Nicotiana: How to write a domestic horror story and gardening book in one. Terror so subtle it could happen to you, olives so ripe you'll be picking in no time:Dirk has a lovely garden. He also likes trees. A lot. There's a guy who gets his legs chopped off by accident, then there's Dirk's conscience. Is he really responsible for so much death? He thinks he is. Coming in with his black cloak and scythe, Monsieur Bogarde lives with his so-called 'agent' who gets colon cancer and alzhimer's (is this Dirk's doing?). They plant things and pick olives and live in France, then they don't plant things and pick their noses and live in England. But death cannot be escaped. Dirk has a stroke, his 'agent' drops dead, and they all live happily ever after. Based on a true story.
__label__2 If you loved the First Outbreak, You'll love this one: Something to always look foward to in a Sequal is the gameplay you loved from the first. That's the Great thing about OUtbreak 2, it has the same controls, but this time you can CHOOSE who you want to play with you. for instance, If David does not work well with Kevin, but works well with Jim, then you can choose Jim as your partner. Plus you can walk as you shoot! The only downside is that theres not going to be a Outbreak file 3 :(
__label__1 Boring!!!!!: The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed, boy was I wrong. Every level has like 0-3 zombies. I RENTED THE GAME TO SHOOT ZOMBIES, NOT INFECTED ANIMALS. My advice, try it at a friends house or play a demo first.
__label__2 I did it so anyone can...: I am a grandmother with no woodworking experience. I made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners. I looked for help on the net and found this book. Three days later I finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect! The directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them. I have more trouble making a souffle than I had working with crown moulding - thanks to this book. It should be in everyone do-it-yourselfers library. By the way, I saved a fortune doing this project myself.
__label__2 Good Book - Presumably in Either Edition: My daughter (almost 3) enjoyed this book from the library last Halloween & we're looking forward to reading it again this Halloween. I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors, rather than scary monsters, pranks, or candy. The illustrations were lovely. I'm sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too, and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite. But I'm guessing that most people who, like my family, discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss.
__label__1 The Worst of Kirk Whalum: Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
__label__1 worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all: I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors, Save $8 by not buying this product ...Very thin and very large sized shirts .... they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ...
__label__1 Horrible product: This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market. The fabric is cheap, so cheap, that I threw the darn thing away
__label__2 Shirt in picture is not what they send you: First off, the shirts are good. They are thin, but they look good. The collar tips have built-in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp. They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle. However, the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you. The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher, textured material, and the actual shirt has a white label, not black as in the pic. So, expect a very thin, smooth, untextured but stylish shirt, with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice, but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get.
__label__2 Good buy with reservations: Of course the list price is a joke. However, for the price, the quality is quite good. It uses thin material but is fine for summer. It is about 1/2 size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes. Just remember, this is not your $65 deparment store shirt. And yes, only the blue colors look good.
__label__1 Very thin, Flimsy: If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $3.99 plus $0.99(per item) return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this "quality"?
__label__1 Poor Quality: I bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap. Because of the cheap materials. Save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality.
__label__1 smack the editors: As mentioned by other reviewers, this DVD is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds. If you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details, forget it! The editor(s) didn't do the Scorpions justice. The music is good, but since this is a DVD and not a CD, I'm giving two stars for the spazoid video technique.
__label__1 A clas-sick that made me sick: This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
__label__1 Interesting but Repetative: While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on, the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over. The only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of Captain Nemo (which i have to say, was never really revealed, and a bit disapointing ending). So all together, and VERY detailed and interesting book, but too slow and boring overall.
__label__2 Oldie but a goodie: I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book.
__label__1 A disappointing read for the 21st century: This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read.
__label__2 Twenty Thousand Leagues: A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast. However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all.
__label__1 Internet connection turns off all the time: After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)
__label__1 A REAL MESS: SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
__label__2 Awesome!: I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover, but the inside was totally fine. The description of the book was completely accurate.
__label__1 Yadda, yadda, yadda!: If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show.
__label__2 LOL!: Good stuff - some funny, some serious, but all the little "stories" you've never heard from behind the curtain at SNL!
__label__2 Narnia: Prince Caspian: It was a great choice between BD and DVD, of course I bought the BD. As you all know the quality is far more better than regular DVD. The movie had a pretty good opening to and it was very catchy. Story has a pretty good plot to it but it wasn't as good as the first movie. there were more action on the first movie compared to this. All in all it was a great and fun movie to watch.
__label__1 Thanks for the case: I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
__label__1 Very Disappointing: If you enjoyed the book, you won't want to watch the Disney version of this movie. Characterization was changed (a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump, Prince Caspian and King Peter had jealousy issues); scenes were added that weren't in the book, and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted. There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie. If Disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie, they should have just hired someone to write one. Prince Caspian is definitely NOT the Prince Caspian that C.S. Lewis wrote. I will definitely not watch any more Disney adaptations of Narnia.
__label__2 OMG: OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from "TL, TW, ATW" came back to Prince Caspian!!! It was awesome... the sword fights, the battles, the waking of the trees, Reepicheep, and the bits of humor mixed in here and there! I loved it!
__label__1 Too Precious: Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe, once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of Narnia's forests. The children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying. Although technically amazing, the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters, other than the children, lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable. It isn't a film we'll watch again and again as we have Wardrobe.
__label__2 Correction on May 16th Review: The software mentioned on my May 16th review IS called "AVID Xpress" -- not "AVID Express" -- when my review was edited someone changed the spelling, possibly thinking it was a typo/mistake?
__label__2 Easy to follow: This is a quick reference or trainer. Use it to help Scouts with their knot requirements. Simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot.
__label__2 Knot idiots, rejoice!: In no way does this little card set replace books or experience, but for field use for common knots, (especially in a stressful situation) it's priceless. I've already needed it on so many occasions (work and around the yard), that I moved one of them from my BOB to my small EDC pouch. If you're anything like me, "kind of" knowing how to tie a specific knot can get you into more trouble than not having tied the darn thing in the first place! I had to secure some items for an typhoon and boy did this thing come in handy. *All* of my ropes and knots stayed tight unlike my usual post-storm assessment of finding them untied and strung out in the yard! Yes, you could probably make a set, but these are nicely printed on credit card like material (albeit a bit thinner) and are really legible and handy. If you have a BOB, this is a MUST have (especially for those you think you need 300' of 550 cord in your BOB).Four stars because I wish you could separate the cards for easier access.
__label__2 Very Cool: I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
__label__2 Have not needed it yet: This is pretty cool. It shows you how to tie some basic knots that can Come come in handy in various situations. I got this so I can leave it in my go bag with 100ft of some paracord.
__label__2 The Wind in the Willows: A beautiful book with detailed, descriptive, lovely drawings, this gift to my granddaughter was well received, and she takes it to bed every night.
__label__2 inspiring: a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did, anyone can. i'd give it 5 stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee
__label__2 The recipes sound great.: I look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information. However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe. This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup. The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count. Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.
__label__1 One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.: Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, "lesser climbers", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American "analysis" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so.
__label__1 Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!: The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing "Into Thin Air" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!
__label__2 The bittersweet summit: A must read for anyone preparing to climb. You will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant, the hurried, the unprepared. This extraordinary story tells of the extreme suffering endured to achieve the summit. You learn about the death zone and about what happens to the body at various altitudes. An excellent adventure story for both men and women.
__label__1 I was disappointed: I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish. As a redhead, I feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left... hanging, somehow.I found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read.
__label__1 Was she serious?: Since I have a red-headed daughter, this sounded lioke a fun book to read. I gave it up just about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe it got better but I wasn't going to stay around to find out. The author really stretched it to make her point. Her point? Maybe becasue she's a redhead, she wanted to be so very, very special, so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them. Come on! Trying to make redheads all some sort of special witches, monmsters, super-human people was dumb. And she totally dissed red-headed men. My husband read it through but we both quickly decided NOT to send it to our daughter.
__label__1 It's okay.....: I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair, sensitive skin, and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type. It also has a great high SPF.But, alas it does not sink into my skin. It does not blend well at all. It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in.Maybe because of the high SPF? I am not sure,but I was definitely disappointed.
__label__2 Excellent Series, Poor DVD casing: The series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the Robin Hood legends. Clannad's music adds a bit of authenticity, as does the use of magic and superstition, and the UK setting.Acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film. Colour was on the dark side, but nothing that can't be adjusted.The poor packaging of the 'complete' set prevents me from giving it a perfect score. I like the look and the folding-book concept of it, but the casing is made of hard plastic, making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the DVDs carefully without breaking or cracking them. I had a similar problem with the "I Spy - Four-Pack Collection" cases. So, take care to remove the DVDs lest you damage them permanently. You might consider alternative storage like a plastic CD envelope case, considering this DVD set is not cheap.Aside from this, I highly recommend the complete Robin Hood set.
__label__2 Robin of Sherwood: Picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered. Also Disk 2 had a glitch in it on the first play. Disk is clean. Over all quality is not great.
__label__1 Misrepresented Product: The image shown is EXACTLY what you'll get; it isn't misrepresented on Amazon. The package is mis-leading. It clearly shows a 2.2 mm Hex-nut. It does not work on any glasses that have a hex-nut. In fact, I was about read to toss it out, when I went and took a dental-pick and pick some plastic or parafin out of the tip of it--when I finally got it to work on my CostCo glasses that use a "star" driver. It contains a tiny phillips head, tiny flat-head, and the "star" driver. No hex-nut. I'm going to have to order something else. Isn't worth my time and frustration to send it back.
__label__2 Every kind of comedy styling all in one film...: What makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has. You see not only slapstick and situation based comedy, but also some fabulous dialog and scare comedy. I didn't want to watch this movie at first, thinking it'd be a run of the mill b/w film, but was amazed, and immediately rewound and watched it a second time.
__label__2 One of the best readings about stats!: This book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics, but wants to have a break from formulas and software! In fact, I would make it a must read for all citizens who are bombarded by over-complicated news about all areas of our life.
__label__2 Outstanding book: Someone once said "there are three kinds of liars: liars, damn liars, and statisticians."I read this book in high school, and it shaped my judgement of the news media, business, and advertising ever since. Never trust the numbers without knowing their basis, and remember: a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice, and say that, on average, he felt fine.
__label__2 An Entertaining Primer on the Validity of Statistics: Although "How to Lie with Statistics" is a bit dated (having been written in the 1950's), the principles it puts forth are still valid today--if not moreso than ever--and the material is delivered in clear, concise, and even entertaining anecdotes and illustrations.How often do you hear statistics bandied about in the media or used to try to prove some special-interest point? "Of course" the people quoting the figures must be right with numbers on their sides... until you look at just how those numbers were arrived at.This book isn't truly a guide on how to lie with statistics, but it is an excellent text that informs the reader both how others will lie to them using statistics and on how to interpret the validity of purported statistical data.
__label__2 Clear, Concise, and Fun: How to Lie with Statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics. Every chapter contains plenty of real-world examles that provide excellent insight into the concepts. The book is a quick read (only 142 pages) and it holds the reader's attention; both are necessities for an educational work. How to Lie with Statistics is perfect for the beginning statistics student or anyone who wants to learn how they can be decieved through the manipulation of numbers. The reading level and math make this more appropriate for high school or college students than for younger students. Using three randomly selected paragraphs, the mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 10.4; thus this book is excellent for sophomores or advanced freshman. Although the writing is a little dated (1954), it is still clear and highly relevant. Overall, this is a highly recommended and worthwhile read.
__label__2 An Up To Date Primer!: This book is a very good primer for getting one's feet wet in the world of non-profit organizations. While it is by no means exhaustive, it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their non-profit more efficiently and more ethically. It covers excellent project, team and board building strategies, as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation. Additionally, there is good information on employing the internet for communication, engagement and fundraising -- STILL a fairly new field for many.Appendices A-C cover some very good tools and examples. Though the listed government grant sources in appendix D focus mainly upon the Humanities and the Arts, valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas.
__label__1 sony printer: not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz
__label__1 A waste of money -- and tin.: This collection amounts to three dollar-store discs jammed into a pretty package. For those who prefer substance over style, look elsewhere for this material, which is given a pretty shoddy presentation overall.Disc 3 (which was unplayable on the two DVD players I tried it on) repeats the entire contents of Disc 2, and adds the TV pilots Kook's Tour and Jerks Of All Trades -- making Disc 2 a pointless redundancy. Avoid it at all costs.
__label__1 Misleading: You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection, but mostly contains fillers and short dvds. It appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted. One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons. If you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little.
__label__1 Not what I expected - a rip off: The price was attractive, as was the packaging. The box shows Curly. But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation. Also - a lot of the "extra features" are lame. Stay away from this product. If you really want the Three Stooges - buy the 8 volume compilation from Sony instead.
__label__1 Total rip off: The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says "7DVDs over 11 hours" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class, a real eyegrabber, but whats inside is junk.
__label__2 Good Read: i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it. I enjoyed it but will not read it again.
__label__2 Quite possibly the scariest novel ever constructed: Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print.
__label__2 chico hamilton timely: cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
__label__2 I hate reductionists: As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But, as an incissive criticism of reductionist science, especially biology, it is very good.
__label__2 skillful: Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent, old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field, giving his thoughts free rein, following them where they land. In my opinion, the poem "The Figured Wheel" is a lyrical, breath-taking masterpiece.
__label__1 we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate: Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship.
__label__2 Great!: I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough. Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to.
__label__2 Great Resource for Victorious Living: This is a great resource for victorious living! It shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty! It is a quick read - I was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down! I got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the "dating" stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as God intended. I highly recommend this book - whether you're married or single!!
__label__1 Fine Film, Abysmal DVD: This is a fine Randolph Scott film. Unfortunately the DVD has interference on the audio channel (bass-heavy contemporary music, as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made) and the print itself shows damage in places. I have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference. Thanks for caring, Columbia Pictures!
__label__2 Very nice: Item was just as described. Very nice fit...does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect
__label__2 terrifically written, great story.: Ruarke is rightfully called the master of outdoor writing. This is a fabulously written story of his first safari in Kenya and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). It is a must read for anyone who enjoys outdoor literature, hunting stories, or Africa.
__label__2 Great: This eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo 2-3 months. Way more economical to buy here on Amazon than in the store. We reseal it for storage, and use it well before it goes stale (colours and smells still vibrant).
__label__1 choco tacos: I have to say I haven't actually read this book, but I feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation, you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too. Then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself. But if you want to celebrate over Choco Tacos, you would have to go to Taco Johns, I used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat. (see other reviews for this book to understand what I am talking about!)
__label__1 As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.: It's the truth that early Mormon leaders told fanciful tales about Moon Men and the Lost Ten Tribes . . . to their kids at bedtime. It seems there's a difference between what a Mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine, and what they say having fun with their family. It's the same with anyone. This book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine. As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.A better book to buy from Amazon on this subject is Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass : The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) . Hugh Nibley, David J. Whittaker (Editor) / Hardcover / Published 1991
__label__1 Horribly Disappointed!: Don't get me wrong, "Harriet the Spy," was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read "The Long Secret," So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase "Jesus Hates You," should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one.
__label__1 the long secret--: just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only.
__label__2 Good for Smaller bows: This product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows. I have a Mathews Reezen and it was too small. Amazon has a great return policy and traded for Plano Max XT.
__label__2 Presents a way of devotion to Jesus and Mary: This book presents a marian version of the traditional Greek orthodox Jesus prayer. Instead of "Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner", Sister reveals that Jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase "Jesus, Mary, I love you. Save souls." While on the surface the prayer is very simple, it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind, intense desire, and continuous repetition. Sister says that Jesus finds the prayer most pleasing, of great benefit to all souls, living and deceased, and with the help of grace, can be done by anyone. This is a method of prayer for the "littlest ones" of all ages.
__label__1 YUCK!: I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it, other than the rubber smell I can't elimate, but this product sucks!
__label__2 A very REAL book: Leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over, this book simply looks at the lives of people actually in the church: what they do in their normal every day lives. I especially liked the depictions of Latter-Day Saints in nations outside the United States, including the temple trip down the Amazon and a few shots of Victoria Peak! Beliver or no, these pictures tell 10,000 words about a people that are industrious, optimistic, and compassionate. These photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church, the Latter-Day Saints frequently hold the moral/ethical highground on their idealogical opponents. How many other 200-year old American religions would stand under this kind of across-the-globe scrutiny? This book contains real, in your face, irrefutable evidence that like them nor not, the Mormons are indeed a "peculiar people."
__label__2 Summer of my german solider review: I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing. I thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today. The author didn't pull any punches in this startling work. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
__label__1 BORING: I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW,NOT! Weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book. They all agreed with me!
__label__1 A Boring with a German Soldier: Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot, it does not. I didn't like the character of Patty, she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much. The relationship between Patty and Anton is very disturbing, becuase Patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around Anton. The book disturbed me.
__label__2 Good: This was a present for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It arrived in a very reasonable time. It seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
__label__2 Little America: This book was an interesting reading for me. It was one of the best school readings I have been assigned. It was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past. His style of writing was upfront and direct. We did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed, or being vague about intimate love sessions that had taken place. I most enjoyed the idea of the go-cart club. The inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that I have read in a long while. The book also has a sense of being a bit personal. I do not know Henry Bromell, only that he is good friends with ny english teacher, but from reading this book I have a sense that I know a little about him. That is why I believe people write books, is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life. He has, in my opinion, succeeded in doing so with Little America.
__label__1 Disappointing: Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a "Greatest Hits" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of "the book of poetry," ultimately it leaves the reader wanting.
__label__1 Bad quality zipper: We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids, so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip. We test it out at our back yard right after we bought it. It's easy to set up, and roommy. However, the zippers are done in very low end quality. The window zippers work ok, but both the door zipper did not work well! The mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it. The door zipper is not well stiched on one side! And it's hard to zip it around.We are return it back to the store tomorrow!
__label__1 what i thought about this tent: i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in 3 places. and the zippers are terrible always get caught.its roomy but its cheap!
__label__2 Amazon shipping: This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.
__label__2 Good Anime: If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it. Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more. Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it
__label__1 I'd rather stick razors into my mouth: Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks, Doctor's BrushPicks are unusable. The picks have no flexibility or give. Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts.
__label__2 Best band of all time: This Dvd is amazing. Braid is rock at its finest. If you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour. The extras are hands down the best on any live dvd I have seen. This knocked the Impossibles Never Say Goodbye Dvd out of my player finally.
__label__2 well written and complete but a little dated: this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative. nevertheless, it is well written and complete.
__label__1 Smells Sweaty: I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use, I have noticed that it smells worse than sweat - horrible. I don’t believe this is the original perfume. Something somewhere is not right with it. But the original (real Paloma Picasso) was excellent. Everyone used to ask me what I was wearing and where to get it! My $60 down the drain! Next time will try to buy from Macys like I used to and see if I can get the original Paloma.
__label__1 Unsupported by the Constitution: Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money.
__label__1 Not for Hydroponic Growers: This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing, it's not bad, but anything that purports itself as being a "grow bible" should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow. This book contains some information on this, but not nearly enough. For whatever reasons, it includes far more information on genetics and breeding, but most growers I know buy clones or seeds. Those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics.Is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing? Not sure I need it now, but it would have been great to have a few months back.
__label__1 Evident Growing Errors!: Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower, this book may misguide your gardening efforts. If you want real facts, there are better sources out there.
__label__2 Great find!!!!: This book was a great find! It has more information than pictures which is okay, it is very descript in its information and easy to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowlegde in this art.
__label__1 still waiting: This book never shipped. ordered over 6 weeks ago. Smazon still says ships within 1-3 weeks. it has been 4 weeks past their estimated ship date. So don't bother ordering this book.
__label__1 boring & pretentious crap!: This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious.Skip this book... try something else.
__label__1 Heavy going: It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful.
__label__2 DVD Version please!: I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it. I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.
__label__2 Very fun video and not hard to follow!: This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
__label__2 Fabulous: For the first time, I read a book in which I thought the artist was sitting in the room and telling me about her life. The is one of the most inspiring, eclectic, and electrifying books I have ever read. It's just fabulous.
__label__1 I like Elton but...: I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
__label__1 crocodile crock: The king of Crocodile Rock lost his teeth 25 years ago but here he is -again! - plugging away in geezer FM heaven. While old pharts may love the way John's campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their Depends, kids will absolutely hate this flaccidly-themed soundtrack of paint-by-number sugar pop fizz and bombastic lik-a-stik storytelling. Incredibly, The Road to El Doh!rado is worse than Elt's last Tim Rice collaboration AIDA, the 1999 multi-guest stinker currently being loaded in skeet machines around the world. Indeed, the only level this one works on is a cheap alternative for parents who want to sedate their hyperactive whippersnappers without having to shell out big bucks for a Ritalin prescription. Give it a rest Elton, for gawd's sake.
__label__1 not what i had hoped: i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie, not all resung by elton john. the songs lost the flavor i was looking for. if you're an elton john fan you probably would like it
__label__2 Best Yoga video for kids of ALL ages & abilities: Totally fun and captivating with creativty for children 3-13 plus lots of stuff for older brothers/sisters as well as Mon/Dad or any extended family member to partake in. Great pace for ALL. Perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow mood.Everyone will be inspired to increase their mental/emotional calmness, physical coordination, flexibility as well as focus of mind alone and with friends/family.
__label__1 Very slow shipping: The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
__label__2 A Great Book: Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It gave me even more respect for those of this generation. After reading this book, I had to order Mr. Brokaw's other books.
__label__2 The Greatest Generation: Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
__label__1 Great topic, poor writing style: Tom Brokaw has chosen a fanastic topic: the Baby boomers' parents. Their life & times, trials & stamina through the Depression, war(s), and raising families. I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a writer. I was very disappointed reading this book and I made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend & neighbors, and my own Father without pre-reading it. Live and learn, I guess. Sorry, I had expectations of being thrilled with this book...but wasn't.
__label__1 A great disapointment: Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's "The Good War." It "is" what Brokaw could have "had", if he would have imitated the master oral biographer.
__label__1 Mr.Brokaw concentrated too much on officers: Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview,most of whom went into the service as officers,and later became politicians. Where are the uneducated,poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces,fought and died for their country, and, those who survived,returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted? The author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service,making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary; and always as officers,most-repeat-,most of whom never heard a shot fired,the exception proving the rule
__label__2 Greatest Generation: A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets, what happened to them, and how it changed there life, and how they succeeded.
__label__2 Inspiring: I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the "greatest" or not, there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history.
__label__1 A waste of time: Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title.
__label__1 Good idea, but shallow text and a distorted picture: Brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman, but like an awestruck, hero-worshipping kid. That's not a crime, but one expects more from a man with Brokaw's experience and training. I felt the text was very shallow -- especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities. One doesn't learn a lot in this section. Nor does one get any meaningful insights. I also felt there was a tremendous "sameness" about the interviews. Surely, there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views. Brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two. Regrettably, one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News.
__label__1 A book of simple hurra patriotism: I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me, belonging to the post-war generation, it reads as a very shallow "hurra-patriotism" story, without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers. Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book.
__label__1 0.5 g of Trans Fat per serving: I bought some because it was advertised as "A healthy snack choice..." only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil.
__label__1 VTech i6775 Review: Years ago, I had purchased some VTech products and was very displeased with the their quality. At that time, I swore never to buy VTech again.While recently seeking cordless phones with speakerphone options, I came across the i6775. The price was right, and some time had passed, so I bought two sets (home and office) in June, 2006.There's only a three month warranty on these units, and one set recently (11-2006) died. After finally getting through to VTech support and troubleshooting with them, we couldn't revive the system. The phones are useless, and I'm stuck with them.You can guess my advice.
__label__1 No. Just No.: looks cool. Key word people "looks" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part.
__label__1 Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK: This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
__label__1 this is not the latest version of the book!: I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously, it is not, although it is printed in 2008.Amazon should specify the edition of the book!
__label__1 the paper back edition is a pirated, unauthorized edition: These paper back editions are pirated and unauthorized. They do not contain the modern emendations.DO NOT BE DECEIVED AND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IT PROTEST TO AMAZON.
__label__1 Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ): The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old, the charts are hand-made and frankly speaking now it's possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact. If you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest "Welles Wilder - New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems". Modern and better books are those of Achelis and Colby.
__label__1 NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!: Hello Champions, this IS NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND by downloading it from the band's official website webstore (2SJ.com) where it's available for LESS MONEY and in Hi-Res format!-=AA/2SJ
__label__2 Body Movin': When you hear the term rap-rock these days, you probably think of artists like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. But the label applies just as well to 2 Skinnee J's. The J's mix Beastie Boys-style old-school rap with guitar riffs and a healthy dose of humor. Clear some dance space in your bedroom and shout along to the hilarious "Stockholm Love."Best Song: "3 Minutes"
__label__2 Humorous bathroom material: This is a great bathroom reader. I find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off, but I imagine inventing new words would be quite challenging.
__label__2 True Love: This is a very good CD. There is no song on this CD that I don't like, even though the radio only plays one song.
__label__2 A significant book in psychology and the Bible: Johnson, a clinical psychologist who is a graduate of Fuller Seminary and Fuller Graduate School of Psychology, writes a clear and careful study of the psychological factors that can unconsciously affect the way people read the Bible. He points out how issues of perception, cognitive process, social interaction, and culture can shape how a person interprets scripture. He writes from a committed Evangelical position, and is not by any means reducing the meaning of scripture to merely human processes or psychology. Still, he does caution against the naivete that says, "I don't interpret the Bible, I just read what it says."This is an essential volume for anyone interested in psychology, religion, and the Bible.
__label__2 big improvment: My Dell 2650 has 256mb of ram total. More then one program running and it would slow down sometimes freeze. I took out the two 128mb sticks and purchased two of these, getting a total of 512mb. Its still not a lot compared to modern laptops, but it was a noticeable improvement. Now I can get on the internet while a program is running and not have it slow down. Nice product.
__label__1 Sounds not like yoga instructor... Really I apologise for my feedback.: The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal, loud and unpleasant voice!!! I don't understand it even... But I like Seane demonstration. Seane is a fantastic demonstrator, that's advantage of her. The sequence is really senseless for detox flow. But it's good for beginner without full audio mix.I'd like to ask why the video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement? Its something they give this DVD as free gift...I tried both workout Twist and flow, Purify... Really its not going to work with detox. Well, I agree that She studied Pattabhi jois Ashtanga yoga sequence with someone and use that for her sequence. Actually here the sun salutation A and B help to open your body, after the body opening, her sequence like warm down your body. I may try with traditional sun salutation with detox flow. Lets see, how its work. Anyhow, I'm not going to play this DVD again.
__label__1 not that good: all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
__label__2 I loved the theme song, "New Direction!" It's a hot one!!: I am more of a traditional gospel person but as I mature in the Lord, I'm able to get pass all of the hip-hop and hype of the music and get the message that's being sung. I am a big fan of Percy Grey, Jr. and I think that his helping produce this project is what gave it that taste of "chuch!" Overall I say that the project is good and I believe that it will bless the listeners.
__label__1 Boring Waste of Time!: I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of "Emotion," a never-ending "Bootylicious," a "Say My Name" mix anyone would be more than happy to do without and mixes of songs that weren't very good the first time around- several weren't even singles! (Dot, Nasty Girl, So Good)To make that sound better, they throw in Independent Women Pt. II, which is taken directly from "Survivor," and hawk a song from Michelle Williams' upcoming solo debut (Heart to Your, Apr. 16). It's sad when the best song on a group's mix CD is one from the member going solo.I would not recommend this CD at all, if you like Destiny's Child, get Survivor or Writing's on the Wall. If you're looking for good new R&B check out Ashanti instead.
__label__1 Fake blue Lights: These lights are not blue.I can't even tell that I've changed mine from stock bulbs.There is absolutely no difference here.They don't deserve one star.Absolutely do not buy these..It's a waste of time and money.CON
__label__1 Do not waste your money.....: I'm a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning. In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money. Yes, it does provide a modicum of instruction, but for the most part it's suppose to be developing muscle memory by having you watch techniques being repeated ad naseum; didn't work for me.If you want some truly helpful instructional materials, look at the Lito Tejada-Flores and Harold Harb books and tapes.
__label__2 60 minutes of encouragement and fun!: Our whole family loved this video. It is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family (both young and old alike), but also gets you excited and ready to hit the slopes come winter. For intermediates, this is also an excellent review of the basics and some things you might have missed along the way. Don't miss this one!
__label__2 A MUST SEE!!! QUITE HILARIOUS!!!!: I purchased this video for my son (who loves them) and fell in love with it. It is my favorite Veggie Tale to date. A must see!! It is quite hilarious especially the silly song with Larry.
__label__1 NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE! 1 1/2 STARS!: I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person, but this dreadful film is so forced that I could barely sit through it. Greg Kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating co-star Lauren Holly. There are a few scattered moments (mostly from Joan Cusack), but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground. I rate it 1 1/2 stars because I was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found.
__label__1 This is a horrible, horrible movie.: I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my money's worth. It was impossible. The dialog was so contrived and mindless. There was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between Kinnear and Holly was nonexistent.
__label__1 Died after 2 years: I read those positive reviews here and bought this item 2 years ago. It worked pretty well at the beginning. Starting from about a year ago, it couldn't keep the rice moistured for long. Now, it is no better than a 20 bucks rice cooker and I have to replace it.
__label__1 too slow!: We bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it, but no one seems to have mentioned it's one huge drawback: it takes FOREVER. I tried to make two cups of brown rice this evening. After 75 minutes the water was just beginning to boil. As a working mom, I do not have 2 hours to make rice every evening. Yes, I suppose I could get in the habit of setting up my rice in the morning and setting the timer. But this requires a level of menu commitment I don't presently have. Or, I could go back to our old one-button cheapo machine that cooked white rice in 15 minutes, brown in 30. My husband is Asian, but I'm not. He may like the rice better from this machine, but I'm cooking it and I'm fed up.
__label__1 Quality of cooked rice went down after about 1.5 years: For the price, I expected this unit to last longer than my parents' bigger and less expensive cooker (can't remember the brand of their rice cooker--either Panasonic or National) which they've used EVERYDAY for more than five years now, and it's still going.My family didn't use this Zojirushi everyday--but we were pretty close! After about a year and a half, the rice doesn't keep as well as it used to. It dries out faster and doesn't cook as evenly as it did while it was under warranty.I noticed most (if not all) the positive reviews were posted after recent purchases. The handful of reviews from folks who have owned and used this item beyond warranty isn't as glowing. Please keep that in mind if you envision using this rice cooker for years to come.
__label__1 Broke in 10 months.: I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
__label__1 Just after 2.5 years, it is toasted: We bought this 2.5 years ago. It was very good at the beginning. However, just after 2.5 years of light use, it is now toasted. The rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than 12 hours. We thought Zojirushi stands for quality and durability. We made a big mistake.
__label__2 THE little appliance that will.....: All I can say is that every working, healthy and modern kitchen should have a fuzzy logic rice cooker and by buying a good one that will make Porrige and has other modes, you open it up to providing all kinds of wonderful and creative meals.
__label__2 We love it!: I purchased this rice cooker as a Christmas gift for my parents. I was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My parents loved it - my mom has Alzheimer's so my dad does all the cooking. He has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals. Once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well. The cooker is very easy to clean! We are very happy with it. Ours is made in Japan
__label__2 Best white fluffy rice I have ever had!: The rice turned out perfect! Very different from other rice cookers I have tried. I am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the LCD display though since I don't intend to plug the machine in all time.
__label__2 great item: I was a little confused by reading reviews but I decided on the goFit ball at 65cm and it worked out just right for my 5'8" frame. There was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided.Did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my 215 lbs of body weight.I would recommend this item.
__label__2 Like it: As other reviews, band around ball showing the exercises is unnecessary and not nice looking. Functions well, no problem with the pump. Use it as an alternative desk chair.
__label__1 Way too soft: It is possible I got a defective ball, but I bought this with the intention of using it for p90x2. I inflated it following the directions precisely, but I found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much. It is very high quality and was nearly odorless, but I highly suggest going for a cheaper ball (I'm now using a TKO ball) that is more firm.
__label__2 Change the picture please!!!!!!!: I read the reviews prior to ordering, the color indicated in the photo was purple (which I really wanted) but I took note that several folks received red. I ordered anyway and of course received a red one. In spite of not getting a purple ball I still think it's a good product. Heavy duty, which was important to me since I need to "trust" my ball, as I too am heavy duty. It holds it's shape and it's volume of air and I feel very comfortable on it. I'm in a stability ball class and have tried the other balls there and like the weight and feel of my "red" ball. I'll probably order another smaller one, a 55cm. The 65cm is great for sitting but a little to large for some of the other activities so I think having a pair of different sizes is the way to go.
__label__1 Not been able to inflate it fully yet: We have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet. The go fit customer service is open only monday - friday 9 - 5.So we haven't used it yet. I think i should have just bought it from a local store. The instructions are quite poor.
__label__2 Great purchase: A coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. Great value, arrived promptly. This one is fairly large, but I am 6' so it works great for me, shorter folks might want to try one of the smaller ones.
__label__2 Big, tough and relatively easy to inflate: This ball is extremely durable, a great size and was easy to inflate. For tall people, it is excellent. The skin is thick and we have had no issues with it, and do not feel any danger of it popping.
__label__2 Having fun with the ball: My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well, and also our kids love it. It's pretty big, so to them it's the ultimate toy. I'm happy its anti-burst, and I can see us using it for many years, it is very quality.
__label__2 comprehensive book: This book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems. Very rich in detail. I found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
__label__1 Huh???: This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
__label__1 Effortless and Misleading: When I bought this box set, I expected to recieve compact discs that were fully remastered with 24 Bit Technology. Instead, they sound exactly like the original discs I already have. While you may find several top quality country hits in this set, the sound quality isn't up to snuff for today's standards. So now I'm stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks.
__label__2 What is this gorgeous chaos ?: Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
__label__2 thoroughly enjoyable, respecatble: Thank goodness for the Beta Band! I must say this album is a real treat for the ears- sonically broad, lyrically uplifting, and overall a good time for all. Kinda like if Graham Parsons spliced his genes with Beck Hanson, had a daughter, who then married David Byrne and had a mess of kids, thereby amounting to the Beta Band. Musically, it's that hard to pin them down, and that's a good thing. Definitely an album that can be enjoyed for ages on end- the only drawback I felt was the appropriately titled 'Monolith'. But hey everyone is entitled to their madness.
__label__2 A great guide in simple terms!: A great, comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context. Also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against Afghanistan and Al Qaeda. Now I know why this happened and what to expect. The news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo Anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts. Highly recommended!
__label__2 more than "disco": In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd, would be doing it a grave disjustice. It would be like calling the Mona Lisa just a painting or the statue of Dave just a rock. This is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded. The blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics. My only regret is they didn't release all of thier gems out on one compliation. This is a must have for any disco, house, dance, or r&b collection.
__label__2 Childhood favorite: This was an important book to me when I was a little girl growing up in Colorado. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end, three row up, reddish hardback cover.Over the years I'd forgotten the title, I just remembered that it was about a little Native American girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky. After a tedious search of my old towns online library (yay for modern internet searches) I found a title that rung a bell and won a copy on ebay!I'm so happy to have this book on my shelf now. Wonderful, wonderful story.
__label__2 Delightful: I loved this book as a young girl. I loved the message about finding your talents and making the most of them, even when you are feeling out of place or far from all that is familiar. I've been looking for it for my children for years and am so thrilled to have finally found it!
__label__1 "You Get What You Pay For"!: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -"you get what you pay for"
__label__2 Oscar de la Renta Eau De Toilette 8.0 Oz.: My wife thinks this product is identical to the product we found in local stores, but at a much lower price per ounce. She has been using this product for years.
__label__1 Hate it: We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes, we can't even get two bikes on it, they are so squished together.Every time we try to use it, we just get covered in grease, angry, and abandon all hope of ever riding bikes somewhere that is not at home.Foaming raging hatred.
__label__1 Serious flaw with this bike rack. Screws made of PLASTIC!: At first glance this rack seems well designed. In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure. However, after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose. On closer inspection I realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and wouldn't tighten. After pulling it out I wasn't surprised because the screw is made of plastic. I couldn't believe it. The entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw. The screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either. It is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it. I can't believe that Saris would do this just to save a few bucks. This rack went back to Amazon and good riddance.
__label__1 Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors: The Quality is tenth rate, this DVD is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks.
__label__1 Good show. Bad release.: Air is a pretty decent show, though not quite as good as Kanon and Clannad that came afterwards. ADV also gave it a great dub. But it's not worth buying this set. Not only does it cram all the episodes onto two discs, with Funi's usually bad AV quality as a result, but it also strips one of the episodes from the series. It may only be a recap episode, but it's still part of the show.This is not a complete collection, and not worth buying.
__label__2 Heller with a gun: This novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers. A excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
__label__1 Best Keep As A Secret: This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's "acting" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the "good-guy" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D
__label__2 Start here: These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of "the stereolab sound".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy
__label__1 Not what I Thought: I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong, this is trash, one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, he doesn't know squat, and his characters are ludicrous, badly written and boring.
__label__2 tactful approach to adolescent obesity: This movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully. Could be shown in high school health classes.
__label__1 Below Par: I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director, but I am at loss to understand whom.
__label__2 Another great Feinstein golf book: Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved.
__label__1 A Good Open Spoiled: The subtitle should be, "Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black," because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, "A Good Open Spoiled." Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Deadliest Plane Crash reveiew: DVD was in excellent condition, brand new. The Film is very good, well made, very good visuals to go with the story telling, however, this is a short version of the original film, that is the only negative of this production.
__label__2 One of the Best Texts in "Calculus Reform": If you read it through and through, you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical, numerical and symbolic way. If you want to challenge your mind in this way, this book is probably the most suitable for you. I am using it in my calculus calss, and I found the concepts are very clearly explained. The thing that I love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions. This only imperfection of the book, if any, is that there lack of some theoretical exercises. But any book can not be perfect. The most important thing is how you enjoy it. For me, it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus.
__label__1 Nearly useless as a calculus textbook: I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition, and this Ostebee-Zorn text demonstrates why. This book attempts to make calculus easy to understand, but the only result is that it is impossible to follow. Essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage, and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow. Add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual. As a teaching assistant, I have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result. With so many quality calculus textbooks on the market, it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment.
__label__1 I wouldn't recommend this book....too much dam sex!: I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye, Columbus, but I did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion. thank you for the short stories....
__label__1 Drunk SpongeBob?? A Disappointing movie.: NOTE FOR PARENTS: What was Nickolodeon thinking?? SpongeBob and Patrick stuff themselves with sundaes then behave like drunks...down to the staggering about, talking with slurred speech, and suffering from a hangover the next morning on an unshaven, bleary-eyed SpongeBob. The scene could have easily been played with stomachaches.Also, the movie features Patrick in black fishnet hose and stiletto heels- I kid you not!My sons, fans of SpongeBob on TV, rarely laughed and pronounced it 'sorta OK'. We all wished we'd seen someting else. The story was contrived and not even clever.Watch the show- don't bother seeing the movie.
__label__1 100% CR**!: What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie, DON'T SEE IT! It's a yasste of time and money!
__label__2 Great movie: I loved this movie. It's about Sponge Bob and Patrick going to Shell City to get King Neptune's crown. ANd while SB and P are going to Shell City Plankton takes over the world. IT's a great movie. See it.
__label__1 Worst Movie in years!!: This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy, I hope you enjoy being bored.
__label__1 "the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"!!!!: I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually "the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase.
__label__2 Great case: I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.
__label__1 James Herriot's Dog Stories: Out of all the shopping I have done through Amazon, this is the only thing I will be returning! The book only measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/4, has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. In the same order I received James Herriot's "Treasury for Children" which, for the same price, is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and what I also expected from this book!
__label__2 Not for dog lovers only: James Herriot's Dog Stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals. The descriptions of people, dogs, and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination. The accuracy and wit with which he presents people's relationships with their dogs is priceless. When I read this book, I laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people! The sadder stories are written with a balanced view. This book is an amazing collection of short stories. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Really fun stuff: It is hard to believe that this is no longer available new on Amazon. I think this is a great CD with jazz and bluegrass all mixed together. If you want to call it progressive, that works too. Anyway, it is great music. Buy it!!
__label__1 great songs, horrible sound transfer: It is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these, since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience. I used to have this on vinyl lp and should have kept it. The sound was great back then. The CD is nothing but scratches and hisses. Disgraceful.
__label__2 The most versitile shirt you will ever own.: This shirt is great by itself, under an cotton shirt, under sholder pads, and even under a coldgear shirt. The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it. This a must have for your under armour wardrobe.
__label__2 greatest eyebrow product ever made: I tried this product when they used to sell it at Walgreens, as soon as I fell in love with it they stopped selling it. I can't seem to find a place anywhere who sells it. Its pain free and works really really well for something that looks like a sticker. I don't even get my eyebrows professionally done. I use these shapers above my brow and tweeze underneath. They make my eyebrows look perfect!
__label__2 You Nasty: Short remains steadfast w/this release. Production varies, even E. Sermon drops by w/a dope beat for Short to spit to. If you're a fan you will not be dissapointed. His lyrical pimp hand remains strong throughout the duration of the record. Add it to your collection! PEACE
__label__1 Big waste of money (and space in my house!): My 5 year old son wanted this so bad, but when we got it for him, there were so many pieces to put together that didn't fit together well, he never played with it. It just sits on our floor in many pieces taking up toy space! What a waste!
__label__2 Raining Stones at a Start of it all: Remember " Don`t play your Rock`n Roll to me " from Smokie? No? The Gallaghers gave a f... on that. They did what they can give but this one was not to the hand of God... The Following Album after this was going on Jesus Christ Ways; only 4 Albums on the World have the right beeing 6 points on Amazon. Defintiley Maybe this is not 6 points but a full 5.00000 ....
__label__2 Nebula Awards are synonymous with great SF: "Nebula Awards Showcase 2006" is another collection of stories that you read and don't forget immediately. Another great-deal-treasure through Amazon.
__label__1 Disappointing: This book was suggested reading as if " THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view.
__label__2 Happy with the product: I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
__label__2 Palm case: I love this case. It is very hard to keep my palm protected. I carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work. Befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm. This case prevents any damage. I LOVE IT!
__label__2 Good, but some songs were alittle to hip-hop for me.: I liked Soulbait alittle better than this. But Blaze is still good. I like the futuristic effects on the songs and how they designed the album cover.
__label__1 Legal Mumbo Jumbo: This is truthfully worthless books. I had counted at least 20 typos on this book. I also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not. It is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book. The litigation only contains New York, and that is too outmoded. Truthfully, it was a waste of time and money to buy this book. It creates the impression that the doors to a very secretive knowledge would be open to you but the knowledge given in this book is very basic which I am sure any reader worth their salt attempting to venture into this territory might already knows. Truthfully, I was disappointed to read this book.
__label__2 Terrific Reference: As a banker, one never wants to have to be in the position of collecting bad debts. Mr. Lewis has done a great job describing the process -- a terrific reference for anyone who needs an experienced perspective on the process!
__label__1 Love of Siam: This budding romance is a bit...slow. I was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again, I find it quite difficult for Asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story. This is my opinion. I would reccomend that you save your money and not view it.
__label__1 Pretty and very BORING!: WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell, if you're under 15 yrs old, you will love this game! If not, spit on it. What a waste.
__label__1 why do you pay someone to write your reviews?: I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other "reviews" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written.
__label__2 Enjoyable and Instructive: I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners), the layout and abundance of good pictures and ideas will grab most readers and artists.
__label__2 HOLIDAY TREASURE: Barry Corbin ends up with a Korean family that he never knew he had. He is gruff and not accepting of his visitors, not even friendly, but soon mellows during the Christmas season. The usual characters are here - a wonderful series that should have lasted longer. This chapter is just another example of great acting and terrific writing. I enjoyed the old VHS and it arrived in perfect shape. Wonderful, family entertainment.
__label__2 A very good book.: Normally I am the kind of person who goes for books with adventure and fantasy in them. But hey, I tried this one out and loved it. It's not as fast paced as some of the books I've read, but that suprisingly didn't matter. I suggest anyone read it.
__label__1 NaST like a teST: I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
__label__1 Only one part was good in this whole book: This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield, Connecticut. First of all, the characters are the most boring people in the world. The plot stinks. There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful. Just don't read this book it isn't good.
__label__1 OK: This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However, I liked the last part. The last 5 chapters were probably that only part I liked.
__label__1 Boring: After purchasing this for our home library, I couldn't wait to read it before my children did. I was bored and unenthused throughout the reading. The author made great attempts at historical accuracy, just not enough with character or plot development. The story must have been born of facts first, as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent. Along with the lack of plot, those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read. I can't imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities.
__label__1 Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones: I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt. Nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures. The characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence.
__label__2 Love this book: I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
__label__2 The Witch of Blackbird Pond: The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book. It is about the early American settlers, the Puritans and their witch trials. Kit has recently moved to America from a Barbadoes after her father's death. What she finds there are strict religious rules, pious settlers, and bad fashion. But she takes refuge in the company of Hannah, who is called evil because she is a Quaker. When Hannah is acused of casting sickness on the town and escapes, the town acuses Kit. In the end, Kit must learn to change her attitude and the town must learn to conquer religious differences.
__label__1 An interesting but predictible book: This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts, but compared to other books, this one was too predictible. I prefered the book, Beyond the Burning Time. Not only was it better, it was less predictable and more interesting! But read the two books for yourself and you can decide!
__label__1 A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield: This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters, however were very interesting and original. The events were very boring and predictable.
__label__2 A Joy to Read: This book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read. Kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of Barbados in the late 1600's and live with a strict Puritan community in Connecticut. She has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh. One of her special relationships is with an elderly Quaker woman, the Witch of Blackbird Pond. The author is detailed in showing early New England life. The characters are a charming and I will always remember Hannah Tupper. A fabulous book for adults, young and old.
__label__2 The perfect choice!: When we purchased a new sofa that has a recliner on each end, we needed a table to sit in front of the middle seat when it's just the two of us. One that we could reach items from either recliner. This table has beautiful smooth wood; it's the right size & serves as the perfect companion when we settle down to a night of TV.
__label__2 Good Buy: This book gives some good advice on the essay, but an awful lot of the book is not related how to put together your best essay. I bought this after the book "A is For Admission" recommended it. I had much higher expectations for it because of that.
__label__2 True sons of Merengue.: They have that unmistakable beet like their fathers. Which is always good to hear. But they have managed to do create a new style, whch is what makes this one "mortal". As soon as I saw them do one of their songs on TV, I went out to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. It is extremely danceable. I also love the name and what it means.
__label__2 this music will take your words from you: one of the best albums....................ever. any genre, any era. my god, what a knock out. this is the latest musical persona of will oldham (whose illustrious career began as "palace/palace music/palace brothers") and many say it's his greatest achievement yet. i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true. every song reaches in and squeezes the heart, gets all tangled up in your insides. you know what's great about this record? every single haunting track is memorable and affecting. every one. there isn't a single track that fades into the background...and that is a rare treat these days. and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as "a minor place" can co-exist so easily with smothering odes like "i see a darkness" is just amazing. it is, in many ways, like life.
__label__2 Perversely Uplifting: I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com.
__label__1 urethane coating, how about all urethane: It is my girls first year in ballet so I just wanted an inexpensive bag. If you want a really nice bag don't waste your money here. The entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel. The biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well.
__label__2 RI-ON's Plot - Dragon Drive Volume 8: My cousin got this the second it came out, and the amazing action and friendship as well as the "Who do you trust?" undertone continue greatly in this DVD with the introduction of new animation for the theme, "True", as well as the introduction of the character Hideaki. Whose side is he really on, and is he even human? This DVD will keep you on the end of your seat. Dragon Drive fans, you're in for a treat as the final battle is being prepared for!
__label__1 Why do I have to give this any stars?: If you like good music don't waste 12 bucks. May the record stand, I didn't want this CD. My Sister bought it for me. Their anoying voices and pathetic melodies are, well, annoying and pathetic. No good will come of buying this. Spend your money on a good CD like EVERCLEAR or FASTBALL.
__label__1 this album suxxxx: i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
__label__1 Not all that: I am a Oasis fan and to be honest Be Here Now isn't very good . The only good songs are d'you know what i mean , magic pie , stand by me and all around the world {which is too long } . Its no where near as good as the others and isn't worth the money
__label__1 not terrible, but really not good enough: this is a poor attempt at a follow up to morning glory. I wouldn't say its terrible, but I wouldn't buy it again if given the choice, which is a shame really, because their first two were quite good
__label__1 WORN OUT, WASHED UP HAS-BEENS: I don't have to hear only new music all the time, but I must say that Oasis' "Be Here Now" is one album I'd just as soon forget forever. If "What's the Story Morning Glory" defined and popularized Brit-pop, "Be Here Now" sounded its death knell! I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings, but that's just the problem. It's TOO much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the Gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something - anything - a.s.a.p. What makes this album so bad is that it was hyped SO much, which left this Oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride. Oasis may be the most popular British band, but they aren't the best. Much British talent goes unnoticed overseas (i.e. Silver Sun, the Dandys, Shed Seven, Catatonia, Northern Uproar), and that's a shame! Save your money for something more original than "Be Here Now."
__label__2 A terrific follow-up to their last album.: I loved Oasis' first US album, What's The Story Morning Glory?, and this was a wonderful follow-up. The music is crisp, fresh, and has catchy melodies that keep you listening. I love Oasis and I love this CD!
__label__1 Another example of cocaine-fuelled excess: "Be Here Now" does have its moments ("D'You Know What I Mean", "My Big Mouth", "Stand By Me", and "Don't Go Away") along with a few lesser tracks ("All Around The World" and "It's Getting Better Man") and a true dog ("Magic Pie"), but it's just another example of what happens when you're worth $40,000,000, the cocaine supply is never-ending (Noel Gallagher has admitted this and stopped using), and you ask how long a CD is (74 minutes) and you say, "Well, let's fill the <expletive> up".The production is awful. Knobs-up, full stop. Layers and layers of squalling guitars. All hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of "Don't Go Away". The band still rocks out, but the sound is harsh.I almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here, but I've got to deduct one star for the "Phil Spector with hearing damage" style of production. Sorry guys. Find a better producer next time out.
__label__1 Boring...: The songs in this album are quite boring, only a few good ones. I wouldn't recommend it, get their previous albums instead...
__label__2 This one amazing album!!!: I like Oasis because their songs are rhythmic and I like the lead singer's voice. All of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good. There are 12 songs on this album. I like the 4th song " STAND BY ME " because it's really nice when they say ` stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be ` I like these parts!!! And the 8th song " DON'T GO AWAY " is good , too. I found this song is for when something sad has happened to you; It's one of the best song in this album!! So I think this album is fantastic!!!!! I want Oasis to sing many songs.
__label__2 Thank god we have Oasis!: These album is their best work yet, the songs are an interesting conbination of the songs from the albums they did before. The songs has the basic things from the first record, and the elegancy and sofistication of "What the story morning glory" as well, you will hear more details in these one.These is the band of the 90's...and they will be the band of the 2000's of course, so buy it now. Noel is a tired and true music god.
__label__2 Top one!! Mad for it: Why do Yankees always put Oasis down eh? They are the Greatest band ever. I live in the same City as they did and I'm listening to their music 24/7 People just get jealous of their success. If anyone agrees or disagrees e-mail me instantly!!!!
__label__2 You have to know what your doing: This plane takes alot to get off the ground you really have to throw this thing but once its up there your good to go i would recommend to stand on top of hill and throw it so it has more of a chance getting airborne.
__label__2 Billy Joel My Life single: When I purchased this cd I did not know what to expect. I have been a Billy Joel fan for my whole life. I was very surprised during the first listen. Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound. I hope there is more to come. Joseph Leonardi
__label__2 Great book: Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
__label__2 Fun Read!: This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love "old-school" sci-fi. My son wasn't grabbed by it, by the way. So not sure if it's great for kids.
__label__2 The Gadget is it "Too Good": The Gadget by Paul Zindel is about a thirteen year old Stephen Orr. His Father is a scientist that works for the Goverment in the time period of the 1940's. If you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect. Stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him. Matt Hadsell. They both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded. As my title says "Too Good" thats exactly what this book is, so if you like reading or just want an intersting read, the Gadget is right for you.
__label__1 wrong book right title: We were trying to get winter of the world by Ken Follet. So when thats avialble I will order it corretly this time. Dave
__label__2 nice Pitcher: Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
__label__2 excellent: perfect for frothing. well built product. would buyanother in a heartbeat.no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously.
__label__2 Works well, is a bit hard to clean: I've been using the carafe for 3 months, and generally speaking a pleasure to use. it's decently constructed (though by no means heavy duty), and it's lasted so far, even though I'm not gentle on things.My only real complain is that because the carafe narrows at the top, and it's rather tall, it's hard to clean the bottom without a brush.
__label__2 Frothing Pitcher: Given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker.They used it for their guests same day (!) and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher. It's a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
__label__2 The Fall of Reach: This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem, however. This book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all. There are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend The Fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections.
__label__2 These books Rock!: Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game, Halo. After reading it I wanted to play some Halo and kick some Covenant rear!
__label__2 Typos Galore: I'm almost finished with The Fall of Reach and while I love the story, the editors need to be shot. Wherever there is a word that has the letters "f" and "i" together, they're missing; ie: file is le, and officer is of cer. I think there's a date typo too where it's supposed to be the day after and they didn't change it. It's a little confusing and takes from the read when you have to pause and figure out what's being said. I'll update or comment when I finish the other 2 books, hopefully they're not as bad.
__label__1 Stop Screaming: Now, I am a HUGE fan of Jack Off Jill, My Ruin, Otep ect... And those chicks can scream. However, the vocalist of Sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming. The singers oj JOJ, MR, Otep ect... Put power behing their music and make it enjoyable. Sugarcoma just makes it annoying. She does have a nice singing voice, and the band is very talented. I think Sugarcoma would be better off if she didnt scream...
__label__2 A Valuable Gift: When you are at a loss to communicate, much less comfort a friend who has experienced a death, this book can speak for you! Consider giving it as a gift, more personal and more everlasting than flowers. If you have lost a loved one, take this book as your own companion to help you move through your grief. Someone who understands is waiting in this book to support your journey. It will help.
__label__1 Pass on this one: This book was not what I expected. The author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the Russian "system" rather than explaining the what, how, where, and gory details of biological warfare. If you are looking for an exciting read, pass on this one...I did read the whole thing and I can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up!
__label__2 THE HUMPER STILL DEFINES (AND REDEFINES) LOVE: If you can get past the cover and inside photos --- a Humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined --- you will be for a warm, fuzzy surprise. The Humper still has it: smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible, all showcased with his three-and-a-half octave range. There are covers --- "Volare," "Penny Lane" (perhaps an homage to The Beatles, the group whom he knocked off the charts with his No. 1 hit, "Release Me"), "If Tomorrow Never Comes," "This Guy's in Love With You" and the underrated Aznavour anthem "She." There's an infectious taste of calypso with "Brazil," and a truly likable country-flavored " How Slow We Go," co-written by the Humper's daughter, Louise. The best track is the title track, "Definition of Love" --- proof, indeed, that the man still defines love. Now a bad way to celebrate 35 years in the business of making love on the record.
__label__2 It was pretty good: I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However, he seemed to repeat the information a lot (guess repetition is the key to memory). It was to a point that annoyed me though, then again repetition annoys me period. lol. Also, somethings kinda contradicted themselves, but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and I did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you. Which will! give you more injuries later down the road.
__label__2 If you run you have to give it a try: I read ChiRunning in Sep 09. It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running. I've been ChiRunning since.It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints. I now run 4x a week, an hour or two each time. This is something I'd never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and I'd have to train on an elliptical afterwards. The knees are fine now. I'm sure Danny wouldn't recommend it, but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique - I ran 10k on a poor knee without much loss of speed.My timing has also improved, though not as much as I'd hoped or expected (hence 4 stars).Enjoy running? You should give it a go.
__label__1 Not worth the time: I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading "The Working Mother's Guide to Life" which seems much more friendly and helpful.
__label__1 Wha?: I don't get this CD. I listened to it, listened to it again, chased my cat, cheeseyfranks, with a Salisbury steak TV dinner, listened to it again and nope, nothing. It's more average rock by bands that Mark Knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of Procol Harum's Las Vegas comeback effort. It's junk. Kroll was all about Sparta about 6 months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network. He now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line. Anyway, Sparta is a waste of time only Saved by the Bell, the pre school years, can compete with.
__label__1 take a peak first: A fast read, has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society. Seems a bit outdated too, at least my 1992 edition does. A lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web. If you are going to Japan through JET, you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to Japan. Definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying, probably give it a pass.
__label__2 Amazing song, great performance, wonderful voices!: Mariah and Whitney are (together with Celine Dion and Aretha Franklin) the greatest singers alive! They really show their voices power in this song, and they made a wonderful job together! Well done, girls! Well done!
__label__2 Generally good; viewing angle annoying: I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said. What I dislike most is the are extremely narrow viewing angle and the lack of antireflective coating. Otherwise, it is a generally good device.My wish list for the next version includes built-in Wi-Fi and the ability to browse the network neighborhood and pull media files from any machine on the local wireless network, and an internet browser :-)
__label__1 Doesn't Work!: For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it. This movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesn't work.
__label__2 8 BEAUTIFUL WOMEN: During a snowstorm, eight women are stranded in a French country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch. Slightly bizarre, low-key French film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance. It has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players, a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind. This is as intoxicating as a glass of fine French wine.
__label__2 The passion for life is ageless: Zorba the greek is a novel that has inspired me since I was a child. Alexis is a man that has this atomic reactor in his body that he cannot control. The coal mine owner, his boss, starts to realize little by little what Zorba is all about. Despite that his worker is not educated he learns a lot about life from him. This kind of novel is the one you do not forget and in my case is present for many situations. Zorba is never let down by failure or tragedy, take your shoes off and dance to the rhytm of life !!
__label__1 Pretty Good...: I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless.
__label__1 buyer BEWARE!: This was the worst pair of headphones I've ever bought, and it was not easy to get the local Bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised "no hassle refund" policy.Terrible sound, poor ergonomics, medicore "noise cancellation"---never again will I buy another Bose product! I should've known better, my husband has a ridiculous Bose Wave radio which he now tells everyone that he "won at a Christmas raffle at the office" because he's too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing.My son pointed me towards a pair of Sennheisers which were better in every respect, and at one third of the price.
__label__2 Great Headphones: I use these for blocking out noise at the office, and then take them home for gaming. They are very versatile and the sound quality is very good. They do a great job of blocking out external noise, that dog barking, that guy in the next cubical that has to yell into his phone, or that guy that has to smack his lips when he's chewing gum. Sometimes its just enough to put them on, flip the power switch and relax, without actually hooking them up to listen to something. I am very comfortable wearing them from 8am to 5pm, while it would be nice if my ears had a little more ventilation, but that would defeat the purpose of the noise canceling.
__label__1 worst investment: Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore.
__label__1 Excellent Audio, Poor Physical Construction: I've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate. The sound quality is excellent, as is the noise canceling. I used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room, and the performance on my iPod is outstanding. But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties, and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through. Granted, I use them almost every day, but they don't see rough use - and this isn't the type of endurance I'd expect from a $300 product. The two year warranty isn't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off. When I contacted Boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for $100.
__label__2 Only one problem with the backgammon set: I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks,Gary H.
__label__1 hmmm...: Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to get it used. Also I would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may "find themselves" with a more well defined sound. You catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the Beastie Boys on another level... they need to just try to be Quarashi but they clearly aren't entirely sure who that is. The first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion, it absolutely rocks but the rest of it doesn't have the teeth that track does. If you like this first track don't buy the whole album for it, the entire album is only 41 minutes.
__label__2 I think you should read this.: I think it was a very good book, especially if you are interested in Indian crafts or building a bow and arrow.
__label__2 I own this - so should you...: I'm a professional chef and a big fan of German knives. I like a heavier knife in my hand that I know will do the job all day long that I want it to. This set is amazing and I use it every day. Granted; I have swapped out a few of the garnish instruments for what I prefer to use (hate the zester and the peeler). Turned heads when I first brought it out at work but everyone wants to borrow my knives now due to their superior quality and sharpness. I wanted something other than a tired out knife roll that everyone has and have not regretted a single second of owning this item.
__label__2 Elli: Coming of Age in the Holocaust: If you are ready for a stark, unrelenting description of life in the ghetto, Auschwitz and Dachau, this book doesn't let up for one sentence. Amazing story and written in a way that is poetic but easy to read. The book is classified as fiction but it is really a memoir, with names changed. There is no way anyone could make this up.
__label__1 TYPOS, TYPOS, TYPOS!: I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!
__label__1 I didn't think it was that great.: Maybe it was because I didn't know the story of Cupid and Psyche before I read the book- but I was not overly moved by this book. I especially did not enjoy Part II, when I just kept wondering, what the heck is going on??? Thank goodness that Lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end- it might be helpful to read this part first.
__label__1 Don't bother!: I love this group's early feel-good canadian rock n' roll, but I stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall. With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!
__label__2 Great for a laugh: If you appreciate the finer aspects of life in rural Southern states, you need to buy this DVD for a good laugh;
__label__1 Did we see the same movie?: I couldn't wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews. But .... Without having read the reviews or other synopsis', I wouldn't have had a clue what was happening in the movie. There were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were. I like Christian Bale,but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing. And as for Katie Holmes, her acting was like a piece of cardboard. Thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment. Sorry, because I know the other reviews are great, but you must have been watching another movie.
__label__2 Batman Scores A Win: Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson,Michael Caine,Gary Oldman,Morgan Freeman) make this film the best Batman movie yet.The director takes a different course than previous films,Batman Begins is dark and sinister.We see why Bruce Wayne turned to crime fighting.The film is chock full of suspense,action and high tech gadgets.The HD DVD version is a flawless transfer and a worthy addition to your collection.
__label__2 Best Batman Series!!! Great Beginning!: Best Batman Series!!! This is a great start to a fantastic story line! This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!! A must see film and must see series!
__label__1 Review Style comment: If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the "Batman" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex. I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series.
__label__2 Batman Begins Blu-ray: Muy buena adquisición, el producto llegó a mi oficina 4 días antes de lo estimado, en excelente estado. Sin duda compraría de nuevo.
__label__2 A New Batman: I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back. I wanted the new take on the character. The movie doesn't disappoint. It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
__label__1 no batmobile!!!!: -1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
__label__2 The Best Batman: As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot. While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others. You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place. Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great. The whole movie had fantastic casting. Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen. I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.
__label__2 title for my review.: I rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for DARK KNIGHT RISES!!! This movie was awesome, was really sets up for the next movies. Along with the other two, this movie is a must. Plus because i didnt own the dvd, Amazon was a fantastic alterative, with superb streaming quality!
__label__2 may be a bit overrated: I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it may be a touch overrated. Adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast, especially Christian Bale, who comes across as interesting, charismatic, and likeable. The imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a Tim Burton rendering. Nonetheless, the Batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition.

__label__2 Cool movie but NOT "THE BEST EVER": I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman. The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough. I like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear. The early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast.All in all, Batman Begins is a good movie. I just think people need to think twice before they label Bale better than Keaton. HEEEELLL NOO!!! :O
__label__2 batman begins: batman begins is the best movie of 2005!christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it!this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels.so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan, the scarcrow who could destroy poeples minds into panik!this movie is awsome!
__label__2 Very Good: Very entertaining. Good quality Blu-Ray for the theatrical version. HAve not yet explored the special features.
__label__1 I'm not sure why this movie got good reviews: I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful, the plot ridiculous (we have to destroy it in order to save it). I wish Liam would stop taking on mentor roles.The final scene was physically impossible (swinging under the train as it was moving. just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up)
__label__2 Best Batman movie until Dark Knight came out.: Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a "superhero" movie fan, you'll like this one. This takes away the "supernatural/superhero" aspects of other comic movies, and turns it more realistic. Highly Recommend.
__label__1 It's below average.: It contains a lot of action. However, it does not appeal to me. The acting is not engaging. I don't feel related to the plot. I prefer Spiderman 2.
__label__2 a good batman in long time: i saw this movie this past summer it,s a good movie it,s better than other two batman movies batman forever and batman and robin. this movie got something right as far the comic goes theJoker did n,t kill bruce pranets keaton did a better job as batman mr bale played a good batman this movie. Has Minor actor in it a good saga review 7/10
__label__1 This movie was never that good.,: I also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set. The extra disk does nothing except waste your time.
__label__2 Batman Begins: It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
__label__2 It has been said before but bears repeating, Best Batman Yet!: Christan Bale as a young Bruce Wayne/Batman is a much needed reinvention of the Batman movie franchise. He has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the Dark Knight. I was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his own.The story is tight and easy to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the parts filmed in Iceland. Big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes. Just fabulous.The 2 disc DVD set is spectacular. The video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid Batman fan. The compilation comic book is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set to anybody.
__label__1 Would Not Recommend this Toy: My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy. My son has MUCH more fun playing with his Mega Blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks. Hope this review is helpful to you!
__label__1 Sounds like a good idea, but....: I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. I had bought some of the "trucks" and wanted him to have Bob and Wendy too. I found this set and thought it would be great. They ONLY good thing about this set is that he has Bob and Wendy.The clicking blocks sound like a great concept, but they don't work. If you can get them to click you are lucky. You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us).
__label__1 Could be better: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.
__label__1 Disappointing: Firstly, I found this cream to have an odd smell to it. Secondly, it moisturizes well but not as well as I had anticipated and hoped.This product was disappointing and I do not plan on repurchasing. There are other products from NeoStrata that I love but this definitely is not one of them!
__label__2 Crystal clear production and interesting arrangements.: I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically, the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals. The synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring, if at all - they pound, scream and soar through the average sonic boundary.I agree with Virus mag's review in that this album is not the most original thing out there, but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together. There's nothing bad about this album per se, but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality.Nevertheless, a good album for fans of dark electro/industrial/terror EBM.
__label__2 Athletic Director: GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!
__label__2 Weighted walking vest: I really like this product..i've been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for jogging...and i have seen results already...it's funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost 10 lbs...the only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really can't wear it under clothes, you just have to grin and WEAR it...at first i felt silly but, who cares i'm doing this for me and i feel better already!!
__label__2 GoFit 10 lb walking vest: This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing, because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you. So, I decided to wear it under my clothing, it is a little bulky but it isn't so bad. I highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest. It is economical and it will serve the purpose of helping toGoFit 10-Pound Walking Vest with Removable Water Bottle Holdershed those pounds.
__label__2 GoFit walking vest: This vest was just as described and the fit was great. It has wide shoulders so the comfort is good. Since I had never used a walking vest, I wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than 10 pounds so removed some of the weights. These were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place. I am well pleased with this GoFit walking vest.
__label__2 Pretty: These are very pretty but I did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red. In a few years as I add more colors to my tree I will have them.
__label__2 Hard To Heat: I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time. I use them in my massage practice as hot packs. The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile. The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it. I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it. UGH it is a pain. Haven't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly. Otherwise I love it.
__label__2 Great product.: I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro, but I'm glad I did. I took a little getting used to, but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference. It's not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit, but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on. I don't have any problems with it sticking to the screen (I have the regular, not glossy screen) when the cover is closed. This is cheap insurance for your computer. Liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster. The repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty.
__label__2 great save for my Mac from my toddler !: This little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family! I feel safe leaving my 3 year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on. Really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore. It would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely, but as is gives me much peace of mind. I think everyone should have one of these!
__label__2 Chirstian "Death" Metal: Yes my friends of this great indstry, this is one of theworld's finest albums of the decade 1990. For so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own. But to bringlight in this world of maddness, this group does indeed bring"spiritual healing" in there heavenly "dark" sound! this groupdoes not exist anymore, so anything that you buy of this bandis a collector's piece! Don't delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat. If you are in to dark and evilsounds, but do go to church, you need to get this gift fromGOD, for this is your album filled with the truth. If you arethe other guy, still don't miss out on some good music!!Big Nutt
__label__2 Excellent Value: Got these to put in my camper, great for a low watt system. I am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers. I wouldn't put them in a high power system (they are rated at 75 watt) but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too.
__label__1 STRUGGLE OF WOMEN: I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot.
__label__2 Charms for the Easy Life: gibbons weaves a compelling, influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another. detailed first person through Margaret birch's eye, this story tells of margarget's coming of age during world war 2. the book tells of margaret's mother (who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsible)and her grandmother (a self-proclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter) with whom she lives. in a dramatic ending, margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered home-life and must learn to face the world on her own two feet.
__label__2 The best feel-good look at life I've read!: I couldn't help comparing this novel to The Book of Ruth. Like Ruth, it is an intriguing look at the life of a girl growing up, and the influence of family members on this growth. But, unlike Ruth, this book is positive. This book is uplifting. This book is a joy to read. This book is about intelligence, wit and love. This is a book I'd like to write! Pick this one up-then pass it along
__label__2 Dean -- Send me your address: Dean -- Love the book -- especially the pictures of Gavin and me -- but you know that. To anyone else who reads this: Dean knows whereof he speaks: He's a good hiker and builds a good, environmentally sensitive campfire. Hope you don't mind my using this avenue to try to get your e-mail address.
__label__1 No happy ending here--be warned!!: ****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end. I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway. Maybe this review will save someone. Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad.
__label__2 probably the best movie ever: this was a random movie I picked out on Netflix to watch and I am so glad I did. I laughed, I cried, I know it sounds cliche, but what an amazing love story. Such a great message.
__label__2 Loved: I caught this movie today on LMN, when I was channel surfing. Unfortunately I missed the first 25 minutes. I tried not to let Kent Moran distract me from the plot, but he's gorgeous. He's a screenwriter, musician and actor huh? Not just a pretty face. Anyways, back to the movie... It was a movie about real people, that I could relate to. I'm buying this so I can see what I missed.
__label__2 'Listen To Your Heart' -- directed by Matt Thompson: Great movie filmed in New York, directed by Matt Thompson and written by Kent Moran. Scenes were filmed with the 'Red Cam' so it feels like you're right there with the actors. It's a great story about a high society deaf girl (controlled by her mother) and an ordinary 'Joe' (who works for a living) who fall in love. His dream is music and so is hers, even though she can't hear. Make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come.It has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the US, one which was 'Best Director' at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.It's another Love Story movie worth watching.
__label__2 An OK Book: This is an ok book. It is action packed and holds your attention. I think that the main charecter, Dick Shelton, is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in Medieval times. Dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy Sir Daniel, the man who had killed his father. I think this is one of the best historical fiction books that I have ever read. I hope that you will like it as much as I did.
__label__1 NOT ONE OF HIS BEST: When comparing Stevenson's major works, this book just doesn't compare. It's wooden, stilted and written in the voice of Northern UK's speech.
__label__2 Transitions: I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this "transitions". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier "new wave" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album.
__label__1 trash: This cd blows nothing worth listening to. Really sucks the big unit. One of there worst cds.thank you very muchyour welcome
__label__1 Unhappy....Constantly Turns Off: Very disappointed with this amp. It has an auto shut off, which is a cool feature. However it randomly shuts off while in use. VERY frustrating.
__label__2 Simple Amp: This amp does what it is supposed to do. Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the AB speaker switches don't allow output to go to both speakers at the same time. Maybe this was in the write up but if so I missed it.
__label__1 Too noisy: An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
__label__2 Just what I was looking for....: Great AMP for the speakers in my garage and Lanai.....Sounds great and easy to useSimple is good...plus the price is right!
__label__2 Works very well: I have a whole-house sound entertainment system, which includes a pair of speakers in the dining room, a pair of speakers in the living room, and a pair of speakers in the bedroom. I have a AirportExpress connected directly to this unit, and it has no problem powering all six pairs of in-ceiling speakers. In fact, this unit is so powerful, I cannot turn the volume up beyond the midpoint because I fear that my windows will break. An excellent product for the price.Note: This unit has a single RCA output, so make sure you use a splitter if you intend to connect multiple pairs of speakers to this amplifier.
__label__1 Horrible Audio, No Teaching: These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible. It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube. I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin. There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this.
__label__1 Not good unless you have a good knowledge of math: I'm not a math cripple but I will admit that I have not always been that great when it comes to math. I have recently grown a hunger for science in general, ( including mathematics of course) and thought I should look for a book to help me grasp math from another perspective. I actually read many of the pages in the book and while I did understand the first couple pages , I found myself lost as I continue reading. As another reviewer mentioned , this is not a book for the layman. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math. I guess I'll just keep looking elsewhere to find books on the subject that will help me on my journey to become better at math.
__label__1 low budget cheap 90's film of pregnancy: 3 or 4 college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant///focuses all around the bar and their goofiness...when word comes out she has a kid, they all rush, not knowing who is the dad and they all step up - but it is pretty playful and not realistic.
__label__2 Great Shorts for work or play: I have bought about 6 pairs of this short. They are very confortable and wear very well. I'm pretty hard on them because I wear them for work. The hold up very well, good purchase.
__label__2 A compelling Biblical story: This Biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of King Hezekiah. The characters have depth and I am eager to read the next book in the series.
__label__2 Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings # was a great introduction to the series. I gained a different insight into the History
__label__1 God's and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1: This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!
__label__2 History in action: I love history - especially Biblical history and this book uses the information in the Bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive. It seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon.
__label__2 It send be back to the Word: Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great.
__label__1 Did Nothing: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
__label__1 did nothing: I got the tea fast, and followed the instructions, only drinking 1/2 cup, which had no effect on my system, it taste pretty good though.
__label__2 Cossotto and Kraus are Favorites: Sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago. This 1971 performance recording, made in Tokyo, though visually a bit dark, is acoustically sparkling with the singers' joy with Donizetti's music. He would surely loudly applaud this effort. Both Fiorenza Cossotto and Alfredo Kraus are at their peak. To say nothing of Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi in supporting roles. This opera, unfortunately, is often overlooked for the better known Donizetti works. Well worth enjoying as the music is grand, the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see.
__label__1 Just Plain Awful: The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the "plot" is completely ruined by the introduction of the "cute little kid who is a computer whiz" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?
__label__1 Junk: When a movie has dialogue like, "I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies.
__label__2 Excellent Stories, So-So Analysis: I enjoyed all but one of the 11 stories in this book from 1927 to 2002. Even though I didn't enjoy Pamela Zoline's "The Heat Death of the Universe" I can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist. "seen as feminist" here is the key I think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story. A few of the essays were spot on -- looked at the author and the story in their historical context. Others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation. The 11 stories are intense and moving, challenging the reader while entertaining. I loved that they were organized chronologically because I could see a flow and development of the feminist voice. I wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more.
__label__1 POOR ATTEMPT FOR A ROCK ALBUM: EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. IT'S LACKS EMOTION, AND IT SOUNDS FORCED. LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO HARD TO SPREAD THE WORD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC, SO DULL, SO PREDICTABLE. ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO.
__label__2 I'm mesmerized!: This book is so mesmerizing! Try "Perla at the Mexican Border..." (p. 41):Her job was to sort through the eyes/ of dolls. Snapping hollow limbs/ into plastic torsos had been a soothing task/ for Perla, like arranging the peas into the pod/Beautiful imagery in very simple moments. Gonzalez doesn't take anything for granted. Small moments become big ones. This is exemplary poetry. I recommend this to everyone I know!!! The NPS made a great choice!
__label__2 The Train Delivers!: Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold, the text right at the level of a preschooler AND it opens up to display a long train! A fun book to read together!
__label__1 ohh god, its those Troma freaks again!: I must say that, even for Troma, this one was pretty bad. A plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists. Now, think Troma: how would YOU work with this plot? Needless to say, there are MANY dead before it ends. I thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie (and smear on a woman's breasts) untill I saw "War". The movie is rather low quality, not like some of the newer Troma releases, but if you like classic Troma, it dosn't get any more classic than this. Not one for the kiddies!
__label__2 recommended for all beginners: There is a little detective in all of us, but in most cases one wouldn't know where to begin. If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from.
__label__1 It's OK, in places poorly written: A very basic book, seems to be a promotional tool for certain tours, if this type of book is your first read it will serve a purpose.
__label__2 The best heart and key pendant set ever!!!!!!!: Absolutely one of the most beautiful little necklaces around. Get it and you will get lots of compliments on how nice it is. I was so happy that I purchased it.I had been looking for over three years for the perfect heart and key set, and this is it. Very nice weight and size and very expensive looking.Trust me if you get it or give it, you'll be pleased.
__label__1 Impossible to read: The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
__label__2 Superb seller and wonderful product: Date: 11/28/2008 (I bought this for Christmas 2008)My brother-in-law had wanted a Clint Eastwood Poncho for a long time but the ones I saw were pretty expensive. Then I saw this one on Amazon. Not only was the price right, but the look and quality are great! The seller notified me immediately that the item was on backorder, but it ended up arriving sooner than expected. Superb seller and wonderful product!
__label__2 Everyday Creative: 30 Ways to Wake Up Your Inner Artist: I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
__label__1 Distasteful dystopia.: Tittle the "ethicist" (more like elitist) puts her faith in Eugenics. Welcome to Nazi Germany for the 21st century.She proposes the development of a contraceptive vaccination universally administered to children at puberty, the antidote only given following an individual's licensing by the government. Now logically, the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion. Forced government abortions. China, anyone? Or at the very least, ripping babies from the arms of "unsuitable" mothers and awarding them to more correct ones. Fascist Argentina in the 1970s?Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used? Hmmm. Remainder table. Should have aborted the book.
__label__2 Not So Scary Anymore: I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say, I couldn't understand why she was getting rave reviews. A coupla years later I saw her on Jay Leno singing a big-band song and loved it. The screaming was a little odd for me, but I recanted and bought the single to "It's Oh So Quiet." Can you say, "Excellent"? I immediately went out and purchased this CD, "Post" and was blown away at how awesome it is! There are so many good songs on here, it is definitley a CD everyone should own. Don't miss it! And by the way, Bjork being scary just makes her oh so much more appealing, wouldn't you say?
__label__1 Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc: I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
__label__1 Missing most of the play!: This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV, Scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of Shakespeare: "Fear no more the heat of the sun ..." So, if you need this play, are crunched for time, and need it to supplement a research paper on stream-of-consciousness and Mrs. Dalloway ... I would definitely GET ANOTHER VERSION!Thanks a lot for the complete rip off.
__label__1 duplicate dvd: This is the same dvd that I had previously purchased with a different cover. I will keep it because I like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
__label__2 Different: This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price
__label__1 Do not buy: I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio.
__label__1 Boring Book: I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes, I judge books by the covers). It was awful...I am not sure why I even kept reading it all the way through. There is no action or anything. He and his brother are poor, his brother gets girls (he doesn't)...boring..boring. I don't even know what the author was trying to communicate with the audience. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read this book.
__label__2 Not too powerful, but pretty fun to shoot.: If you want to shoot bbs at your room mate indoors, this is definitely the way to go. Has a ridiculous rate of fire, which is faster than the Pulse M74, but it is also weaker than the Pulse M74. The hopper doesn't hold as many bbs as it should, however (~70).
__label__1 Ew!: Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs, high protein breakfasts are hard to come by. I made a tofu veggie casserole (not following the book's recipe, but rather the general concept) and it came out wonderful...but all in all this book has been a waste of money- beyond the purchase and shipping costs.
__label__1 not enough calories: This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories, some have less than 100. I don't have time to cook and eat 8-10 meals per day.
__label__2 Too Bad they broke up: These guys really are great. Too bad they broke up before they could really big. they're big but i mean REALLY big. I'm planning on buying this album once i'm not broke. I've litened to thier free mp3s on mp3.com and they are really good. I look forward to the purchasing of this album.
__label__2 A great book for everyone: I didn't think anger was a real problem for me until I got married and some things I thought to be essential needs weren't being met by my spouse. This book has shown me some powerful principles on how to understand and deal with my anger constructively rather than destructively.
__label__1 this is a christian based religious agenda book: It's a trick ! unless you have a religious outlook don't buy this book ! Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense.
__label__1 not a christian and can't use it in my work.: this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
__label__2 Ahhhhhhhh!: This back brush is what I have been looking for for a long time. others I have tried were too soft or were of sponge material that deteriorated quickly or fell off the handle. This one is a good, stiff, scrubbing brush that can get to all those places on my back that I cannot reach.I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel clean and scrubbed.
__label__1 Big Minus: This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
__label__1 Bloody Awful: I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
__label__1 Typical rightwing garbage: The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack.
__label__2 Preparing for adolescence: It was so true! And definitely helpful. Teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through.
__label__2 Rational Anti-mysticism: Healthy debunking: Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk.
__label__2 Scholarly, critical analysis of Islamic religion & history.: Rawandi contends that reliable sources undermine the classical account of Islam and Sufism, and his study seeks to rectify this imbalance through studying the philosophy of religion and traditionalists to provide a new, critical analysis of Islam. Readers already well versed in Islamic religion and history will find this a scholarly, detailed probe.
__label__1 Utter drivel: What a piece of derivative garbage. 311 already made this album and made it better years ago. Give up now and focus on the homework, kids. This music is taking to straight to the unemployment line.
__label__1 I was expecting different: The music is too loud for me but I will send to to friend like that type of stuff
__label__2 LOVE IT!: This is an amazing little pot. It brews fast, no leaking and the coffee tastes great!! I have been using it for 3 months now and no problems so I got my mom one and she loves it!! Great for those days when you only want a little coffee.
__label__1 It's heat plate grows rusty within few month.: Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again.
__label__2 Ionic Breeze Review: I bought this product for the girlfriend, who happens to be be a smoker. Her car always smelled really bad, abviously. I purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly, despite the small size of this product it works very well. Keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in.
__label__2 Funny and smart: These guys are really a good match together. So funny and fun to watch with the family. I wish it had the Thin man, which for some reason I thought this had. But I ended up getting the Thin man collection later anyways.
__label__2 I know I'm biased but..........: This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the "Thin Man" seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age.As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping inWal-Mart i'm that easily pleased, but if you want to see the golden ageof Hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its bestthen look no further
__label__1 Run, Do Not Hide: While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother...
__label__1 depressing and scary: I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, "when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk," and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book.
__label__1 Disappointing romance: Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance. Couple doesn't get together until the end of the book. Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history.
__label__2 Ideal Weight: After having numerous store-bought scales, always thinking, Geez, I don't weigh that much or WOW,I lost a few,only to find out the scale was the culprit. The adjusting wheel would only "Zero" the dial, and not correct the problem. The Detecto "physicians scale"Detecto 437 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale, 400 lbs, Made in the USAis just what I was looking for. After an easy assembly and adjustment I checked the accuracy by putting various weights on the platform, from 25#s to 250#s and it was "right on". I wish I would have bought this sooner, and it's "Made in the USA" !!!!
__label__2 Dennis back on form: Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the "old band" while retaining a fresh, crisp sound. Well wort checking out (as is the album).
__label__1 Disco Queen: Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), "Is that Queen?" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was "Under Pressure." Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
__label__2 A colorful and vivid album, just like the&#65279; 80s ! !: Queen played in 1982 with new sounds; The result was an entertaining record, however much called die hard fans criticized it.
__label__2 Wonderful Collection: I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd, Ana Vidovic, Susan Isbin and Martha Masters, I came across this one. I listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it, largely because I liked the sounds of the duet. Once I received the CD and played the selections all the way through, I think I made the right choice. This is a superb collection. These two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies, with a little dissonance thrown in here and there.I've had it for a few months now and it's still as fresh as when I first listened to it. You know sometimes when you get a new CD, you're hyped up on it and listen to it over and over, but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection? Not this one for me. Whenever I need to wind down, this is the one I listen to and I haven't grown tired of it yet.
__label__2 Wires and Wood: Saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great. This is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
__label__2 good stuff: As a huge fan of Buffy-only the original novels, though, this whole 'series' was actually pretty good. I may still like the gatekeepers trilogy better, but hey, each of these 4 books were only 2.99 or so, and they don't take long to read. Worth a look .
__label__1 what a waste: My poor son was so eager to play with this toy after receiving it for his birthday. But he was quickly disappointed. The tank was too heavy when filled with water and the straps would not adjust enough to fit on him (we had to rig the straps). The tube would come out of the tank when i tried to pump the tank. Which I had to pump repeatedly. Was not a toy that he could play with on his own, someone had to be present to constantly pump it. Was just as disappointed with another spiderman blaster. They need to change the age range on these toys to 18 and up!
__label__1 I don't think nephew ever played with it.: I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
__label__1 Really needs an AC adapter: See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead.
__label__2 Better than I remember: Grab a teen and watch it with them if you've got one around.Saw it awhile ago, wasn't that impressed. Teenaged Daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat with her and enjoyed it more this time.Thought provoking, and a conversation starter.
__label__2 Sixteen-and active: Keir Gilchrist, an impressive kid actor of kid movies, had grown up as well as his character-a sixteen year old sex-experimenting pupil who had checked himself into psycho ward to cure from depression with a single pill only.It is surely a deep-meaningful work for viewers M15+, of a kind of such a medicine and a world in and outside the nut house screened.
__label__2 Sweet story: Great story of a teenager who spends a week in a mental health ward makes new friends and changes his life.
__label__1 ugly lighting, poor cast, trite story: I could not finish this mess...everyone in it should be embarrassed kind of a very poor production , story and cast!
__label__1 Slow Paced and Dragging: Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
__label__1 IZ: Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
__label__1 Disappointing: I give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my Bose. I returned them once, received a quick replacement - the same. Most of them have to be played in the car. Also, I believe Barenboim plays some of the sonatas too fast - just because he can.
__label__2 Loud fast, heavy, yet unbelievably catchy...: I first heard of these guys in a short article of Guitar World and later found this CD at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up. While the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals, humorous lyrics, heavy fast power chords, and screaming solos, what do you expect from a 90's punk band? NP proves to the world, that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear. Their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire-breathing bassist and crazy stage antics. If you like it loud and fast, give this one a try! You gotta love the cover too, heh.
__label__2 Excellent sauce whisk: I love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean. I highly reccomend getting one for yourself.
__label__2 R. Kelly is still on top!: R. Kelly is still on top! TP-2.com consists of 19 blazin tracks, some of my favorite tracks are Fiesta, Just Like A Real Freak, I Wish, I Wish (remix), Strip For You, Greatest Sex, Feelin on Yo Booty, I Mean, I Don't Mean it, All I Want, Just Like That The Storm is Over Now, this track is no doubt the best song on the album, this song is tight! and many other tracks are good too. If don't have this album, get out there and get it. If you don't like slow R&B don't get this but if u do I would recommend this for you. I saw R. Kelly in concert and he is awesome, he keeps droppin those platinum hits for his fans. Get this album right now! ... peace
__label__2 freak come out at night: r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one, if you wanna hear kelly talk about oral sex for the millionith time please get this, if you love bump-n-grind, 12 play and classic kelly then this is especially for you. fellas, ladies you better protection on this.
__label__1 Once again R kelly has done it.......but did we want him to.: R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is, then the next song he's Feeling on ya Boody. R kelly has so much potential to be a respectful artist. But if he continues on the corse he is now, the qualtiy of his character will continue to be decline along with his music.
__label__2 best r&b album of the year: I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.
__label__2 great understanding to helping yourself: this will help you to under stand life and your own self needs and how to listen to your inter soul if you follow your owen heart. it has helped me to see thing a little different.
__label__2 Amazing!: Love this book, it's the first time in my life that I am meditating daily! The exercises are great, the pace that you work through the book is excellent. Sonia really knows what she's talking about, very real and grounded, practical and useful advice. I am getting this book for a few close friends for gifts!
__label__2 Phenomenal Reading Material! Lots of Fun: I'm naturally a huge fan of Jeff Corwin and his work to help nature and its inhabitants is very much needed these days. He does a wonderful job in putting you in the locale that he is in. Vivid descriptions and his natural mix of humor makes this an excellent book for any reading enthusiast. Great photos included. Definetely worth adding to your collection. You'll have lots of fun reading it!
__label__2 Interesting and fun read!: Jeff Corwin is an amazing man who has many adventures to share. His love for animals shines in every word he writes.
__label__2 Great Children's Story: The Precious Moments Stories are great.We like to keep them in our home to share with childrenthat come to visit ~ we enjoy watching them over and over again as well.
__label__2 Good Alertative HIstory.......: An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known. There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.
__label__1 Resurection Day: How many of other readers purchased this book and got to page 277 and found the pages blank to 477? The store it was purchased at was going to just exchange it however in review of the 5 they had in stock, all had the same blank pages. The store then refunded my money. The book was great up until then.
__label__2 Purrfect: These shoes are a little high price wise, but you can't beat the convenience. Right at your doorstep and back into childhood for just a few extra dollars. No brainer. Will be back for more.
__label__2 Really nice shoes: These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy.
__label__2 red converse: Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Plaid Hi SneakerGreat shoes at a great price! My daughter loves them :)
__label__2 Size is off: I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)
__label__1 Not for me: I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me.
__label__2 awesome shoes.: awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy.
__label__1 Linen Chef Jacket: This chef coat is very, very large (I ordered a med.) if you are a ladies size 16 or larger this may fit you -- but the coat has no shaping whatsoever -- so you will look like a big marshmallow (mine is white) -- also, where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space -- which is not traditional and looks very odd. The fabric quality is OK, which for the price is not so great. Perhaps this was cut for men, but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly. This coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap (where the buttons cross over) needs to be re-thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat -- so the bottom hem is not 'clean' -- it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening.
__label__2 One of the greatest plays in English Literature: I have read this play and also performed the part of Joan on stage many times. Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English, won a crown for a king, and was tried and burned as a witch - dead at or under the age of 23. No wonder she was made a saint. The story would almost be a horrible fairy tale, if it wasn't true.
__label__2 Gorgeous music gorgeously played: I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with "the antique music," but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of "period instruments" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played.
__label__2 If you read only 1 book about the death penalty, read this!: This well-written book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty. In addition to exposing current practices, Just Revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context. Its inevitable conclusion, as it demolishes every well-cherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty (with the exception of a clause in the 5th Amendment) , is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge. Mark Costanzo's own opinion is clear virtually from the start, but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact. If you want to learn more about the death penalty, this is an excellent place to begin. It is also a useful reference book as it is chock-full of statistics and anecdotes.
__label__2 Great but: These caps are hard to find. Being a deputy sheriff it is a necessary item to have. I have put it to good. Use and found it to be recognizable and protective. Best yet, the price was reasonable for a quality product.
__label__2 good: Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!
__label__1 hate it: I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it... I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history...
__label__1 Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper!: Be careful scrapbookers!!! This is NOT like the original Cropper Hopper! It is not deep enought to fit 12X12 paper. Don't make the same mistake I did!
__label__1 Poor product from dishonest dealer: Ordered two, and billed for two, as Christmas presents. Received one, which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage. Oh well, my fault for buying jewelry over the net. Should, at least, receive what I ordered, however. So I wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund. Never could get a reply. Threw the one that had arrived in the trash. Would have given this a negative rating, if "1" were not the lowest number available.
__label__1 unseen is the word: I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous "healing" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel.
__label__1 Definitely not Prodigy's best material: Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single.
__label__2 Great tune!: The Prodigy are back!"Baby's Got A Temper" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless, dire amounts of pop-garbage.The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes don't vary too much from the originaltrack, being a dub and instrumental (respectively). I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said, "Baby's Got A Temper" is such a great,catchy song, that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust can't get enough of the tune itself anyway!:) Great video too!!Absolutely recommended!
__label__2 One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!: The first song I heard on this album was "Bounce," and to be quite honest, I wasn't impressed. But I saw the CD at Best Buy, and thought, "Why not." I must say it has not been something I've regretted. This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there, with insightful underlying political protest all the way through. But if you want an album to just rock out to... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway. There is some amazing stuff here. Like "Chop Suey!" a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and "Toxicity" a song about the terrible disorder in the world. With the split of Rage Against the Machine, there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top.
__label__2 Good but doesn't top the first one: As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single "Chop Suey!" is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song "Toxicity" which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album.
__label__2 COOL: Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song,pogo,and chop suey are all realy good.
__label__2 Overall pretty good: I'm going to make this short and sweet: it's not the greatest album in the world because I still can't listen to the whole thing straight through, but I just have to say that "Toxicity" is one of my most favorite songs in the world, you just can't beat the guitars in this song, and the drums are amazing! "Chop Suey!" is also great, it's got interesting allusions to God and Jesus, "Psycho" is good headbanging fun (and warns you to stay away from cocaine too!), and "Aerials" is nice and meaningful. Oh, and "Bounce" is hilarious... but I'll leave it up to you to buy the album and figure out what they're really talking about.
__label__1 [bad deal]: Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
__label__1 I may have enjoyed this album, had i been deaf!: I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop much longer.
__label__2 Real good music.: This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone
__label__2 One of Systems Best Albums: Along with their self titled album, these two are the best albums I have heard ever by any group.
__label__2 Awesome!!: This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Bunch of Garbage: There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
__label__2 shock to the system: Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity, however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while. I now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance.
__label__2 Buy this cd!: This is a great cd.I have listened to this cd probably 20 times and it never gets old.All the songs are good.
__label__1 Complete Liberal Garbage!!: This music is sooo old and tired. These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones..."Lets all Riot, and then cry discrimination when the Police arrest us for commiting crimes, lets overthrow the corupt government, the government puts too many people in jail" etc, etc. Blah Blah. (...) Anyway, musically the CD is average, and lirically the CD is terrible. Only a cute video and MTV's air play (...) have brought commercial success to these sad sacks. (...)
__label__1 Um......: Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot,Static-x,Disturbed,Slayer,pentara and more artists like that.
__label__2 NAZTECH CABRIO CASE: NICE CASE. GOOD QUALITY. PHONE FIT A BIT SNUG TO START BUT LOOSENING UPAND FITTING BETTER WITH TIME.
__label__2 Excellent for Female Infertility & Ave. for male infertility: If you want one book to do it all, get this one.At least it provides you with a vision of most of the issues surrounding infertility.It provides excellent information on female infertility issues.It provides cursory information about male infertility issues.We have recommended and loaned out this book to several friends, and they all were happy with the details provided.
__label__2 must read: I love this series! It's funny, inspirational, and adventerous! We started this series in a small church group and all of us are loving it!
__label__2 Amazing book for future study in Tort Law: I would recommend this book to law students in both pre-law and law school. Well written and covers important cases.
__label__1 global puzzle: poor Adam Crall, reviewer. Cameroon is its own, French-speaking nation in Africa. It is NOT in South Africa, which is also an independent nation.
__label__2 Cool puzzle, not highest quality pieces: We are really enjoying this puzzle, and learning a lot. The information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable.The pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries. The bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit, so the pieces don't lie flat as you make the puzzle. This is frustrating, and you don't get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in, as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesn't quite flatten down. I'm trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books, but I suspect it's just a problem of cheap glue.Still, I give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find, and the content is good.
__label__1 I'll Pass on this next time.: Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
__label__2 New Developments for the middle of a series: I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
__label__2 Another top-notch film about Victoria by Victoria: Victoria Hamilton seems to pop up everywhere, whether in lesser parts as in Pride and Prejudice, in "bad girl" parts such as in Mansfield Park, or in this delightful version of the complex relationship between Victoria and Albert. This one needs to be compared with a somewhat different interpretation of the relationship in "The Young Victoria." Victoria's handling of her long period of grief over Albert's death is also well done in "Mrs Brown." For English history lovers, all of these are worth viewing, interesting, and nicely filmed.
__label__2 Pure Pop for Moog People: Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day. The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music. The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for: Catchy, and completely addictive. You can bet your modern day synthpop bands like Ladytron, Freezepop, Hyperbubble, and Bis listened to this stuff in their sleep. Many say it's Depeche Mode at their best, many disagree. Whatever the case, there's no other DM album like it, and every song is great. If you eat this electrocandy up and want more, there are a few more Speak and Spell moments on DM's second album.Comment | Why no voting buttons?

__label__2 Satisfying your supernatural cravings: If you like battles against ultimate evil, religious overtones, and special effects - with a twist, rent Constantine. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief. Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.
__label__1 Lamebrain to the hill.: Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film plus Peter Stormare and Tilda Swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles. Weisz, Hounsou Stormare and Swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Rachel Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie.
__label__1 Overblown Mess: This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell.
__label__1 Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?: Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show " Mystery Science Theater 3000" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is.
__label__1 Weak, very weak.: Dumb Keanu Reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in it's own right. Keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways. Most of the performances are not very good. (Shia LaBeouf was horrible and made Keanu look like an Oscar winner by comparison) The only performance of merit is that of Rachel Weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance. Unfortunately, while she gives her all, the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects, very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever.I stand with the majority, Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film, so wait for Dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent Runaway Jury or the Shape of things. Two very good movies that compliment Weisz's performance unlike this one does.
__label__1 Should have read the reviews before I saw it.: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book "Hellblazer" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.
__label__2 Finally I can pre-order the DVD!: I haven't been able to get this movie out of my head. I love it, it was such a brilliant take on the comic book adaption. Sure, I was disappointed at first about the casting choice to play constantine, but it turned out so much better than I expected and I grew to love it. I can't wait for a sequel!Reeves did an outstanding job capturing the spirit of John Constantine, and Rachel Weisz gave her all. The two had such great chemistry and I am thankful they didn't overplay the relationship thing by not overfluffing the movie. It's a great flick you should consider adding this to your collection.Kudos to Francis Lawrence for doing such an outstanding job as a first time movie director.
__label__2 creepy cool: Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories.
__label__1 Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?: This movie is garbage, stay home and save your money. My friendsand I were trying to stay awake through the entire film, although I don't know why. Sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time, rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film. When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel, we didn't care what was going on. I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie, they don't matter. In other words, this film is so bad, it doesn't matter who was in front of the camera, no one could save this trash. The film is very dark, shot like a low budget film, with a few special effects.My friends and I can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film.
__label__2 Yay: Some wear and tear on the case, but other than that the DVD itself works great, thanks so much :)
__label__2 Good Movie!: this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now, time to ditch the dvd lol 4 Stars!
__label__1 What the HELL were they thinking?: Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film. They should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead, we have a children's movie that geared to Matrix heads.Avoid this film like the plague.
__label__1 AWFUL.....................: My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
__label__1 Dumb and pretty bad.: What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.
__label__1 Pure stupidly: Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz, (who give the movie's only real performance) for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort, he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watch.The word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage.
__label__1 Pretty bad: Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.
__label__1 Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in negative numbers. -0.
__label__1 Not even a B movie a Z minus movie: Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind, deaf and dumb. I have never been a fan of Keanu Reeves but some of his films have been exciting. He brought nothing to this nothing. It is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor. In short the film was a total waste of time. More than that it was a total theft of time.
__label__1 Comment on CONSTANTINE: I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.Jim
__label__1 This was the worse.: Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over, that's how bad he is. The script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film. Rachel Weisz is great in the movie but she's basically carrying Keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script. Other than her, the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made.
__label__1 Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster.: Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz, who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog. Her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie.See it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie.
__label__2 Additional Info: Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
__label__2 good strong tires: I brought this tires for a friend in 26 x 1.75 she hasn't had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them....
__label__1 Be careful: I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads, like it's name [ city ride ], but after using them for some monthsI noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepared; better to use low pressure.But the most problematic situation is the grip. I got into an emergency brake, a car show up in front of me, the driver was distracted, then the tire was completely stopped but slipping because it has zero grip because the center part which that is smooth is too wide.I am planning to create some groove to them just to using some more time.If you want your life don't buy this tire. I trust Continental but this was a failure. I can't imagine this tire in rainy conditions.
__label__2 PRAISE THE LORD: I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY USEFUL Being a practicing Christan and not being into WICCA or Witchcraft I have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now. I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship. Boy was I dead wrong. The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought. I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around. I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here), and a few days later I received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what I had prayed for using this book came about.I have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so I would recommend it to anyone who asked.
__label__1 WASTE WASTE WASTE: All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
__label__2 Good for price: Yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly, but okay. It was good for the price. Still don't know what the reference to gerber was.
__label__1 Inedible: I made this gum with my 8 and 4 year old daughters. I ended up making 99.9% of the recipe myself. The gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy. The food coloring (red and blue) stain everything and is impossible to get off of your hands...you HAVE to use you hands to knead the gum. The worst part is that even after all of that, the gum tasted terrible! I highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children. Frustrating and a waste of time.
__label__1 Delivery time too slow: From the time of order to receipt, the book took longer than any vendor I've ordered from previously. There were no courtesy notification of when the item was sent to gauge the time of delivery. The condition of the book was as promised. Overall, I wouldn't order from the same vendor again.
__label__2 The Black Crowes are incredible!!: One of the last great southern rock bands is back, and in a big way! By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years. This is true rock and roll at it's finest. If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones, I recommend this cd. The first single "Kickin My Heart Around" sums up what the Crowes are about. They might not have the most talent in the world, but they are great at what they do, rock hard! A must hear!
__label__2 Man of Many Trades: This book taught: That we can master more than one trade, That we should invest in ourselves and be our own bosses, That organization begins at home, and more.
__label__2 At first he seems just an ordinary kid...but wow what a life: This is a marvelous book and an easy read. Even though Ben Franklin seemed to be just an average guy, as you read about him accomplishing one thing after another, you get a sense of his magnificence as a man.I wish I had read this book when I was a kid, perhaps a little of the diligence that is portrayed on every page would have rubbed off on me.The autobiography is amazing in a low key, Ben Franklin sort of way.
__label__2 Good insight to Ben Franklin: I had heard many different things about Ben Franklin, one of the historical figures in the establishment of the United States. This book confirmed some things I had heard and debunked some others. Good book.
__label__2 I wish I had read this earlier: This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men, in those days--but it can apply to anyone) to live a simple and productive life. Franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others, and made for himself a rule of life, which he strove daily to adhere to. He quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed. He gives a good account of a prudent life, but does not spare himself, clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken. I wish I had read this when I was young--I might have been more consistent and productive.
__label__1 ben franklin: dont believe we received this book ...could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book
__label__1 boring: I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me. So that is why it is one star.
__label__1 Not for the Southern Hemisphere.: Quite a well thought out book to take around with you.BUT... limited use to me as there are no Southern Hemisphere maps or details (even the Southern Cross is absent).Would not have purchased it had I realised. At least it was cheap!
__label__1 johny heeering, I am a fan, I DIDN"T dig it....: The magic just isn't here anymore. I think that every cramps fiend's affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face (except for a lack of purpose, drive, and motivation) throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene. even the punks didn't get these guys. This album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramp's album. it sounds like a novelty album for kids. I loved "sinners", though. and for that I gave it another star.
__label__1 Kindle version: You cannot search terms.. every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over 40 pages.This is not worth almost 10dollars for kindle version. Your better off with print. The kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
__label__1 Almost too bad for MST3K...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever! You have to turn the car off or the EM pulse will fry it? Pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when it's off, probably won't kill you though. The big Army truck gets fried as do the guys in it and the good Dr says it fried the the battery and starter. He whips out his cute little red tool box and swaps the battery and alternator from their Jeep Liberty and the big diesel starts! Yeah, right. Apparently the biggest nuclear bombs ever made are pretty light, it only took four guys to load them into the truck, how did they get them into the Russian sub that just happened to be on the west coast? An old Russian Diesel sub can make it to the bottom of the Marianas Trench? 36,000 feet down? Really? And the guy with the pacemaker, why didn't the earlier EM pulses fry his pacemaker? These are just some of the gross abuses of reality, there are many more, don't bother unless you want something to laugh at, in disbelief.
__label__2 Really works!: 1 star because it is messy but this is AMAZING. I've used the freeze away crap and it doesn't work and is too expensive. This is cheap and will work within two uses. Make sure you wrap the area tight though!
__label__2 Success At Last!: Like many others, I struggled for MONTHS with an inconveniently located wart on my finger. I tried three (3) other kinds of retail removal products, and I was thinking that perhaps I was just out of luck. Then, I read through the reviews for this PediFix Wart STICK and was encouraged enough to try one more time. The product arrived quickly, AND MY WART FRIEND IS ALMOST GONE! Excellent.
__label__1 disappointment: After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work. I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working. I tried using this several times and it did nothing. I don't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it. Too me, I felt like I was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work.
__label__1 Doesn't work good, very disapointed: I purchased this product due to all the great reviews. I have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing. My daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts. I am very disapointed with this medicine!!!
__label__1 terrible product: Bought this to remove a wart. Weeks later of apply several times a day...minimal results.I threw it away. What a joke. I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50% and boom...the wart was gone.More expensive, but cheaper than buying the "freeze away" over and over.
__label__1 Not worth it.: I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor, until I saw this product. I immediately ordered it and began using it religiously. A couple weeks passed and I didn't see a change in the warts. The skin around them wasn't looking so good, but the warts were still thriving. I read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar, so I tried that. MUCH better results. Forget this product, just go to the store and get some ACV, cotton balls and duct tape.
__label__2 So far I am impressed!: Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So, after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot. It is working very effectively so far! No pain at all when he applies it. This is my 1st review written on Amazon, but not my 1st reading of reviews. I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews. I am glad I chose this product.
__label__2 Great Item: I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
__label__1 looks like chap stick: I got the wart stick for my grand daughter (11 yrs old) she has a wart on her hand and foot! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i don't know if it works or not.
__label__1 With Love by Hilary Duff: This product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it.Don't like the scent anymore however, I don't know if I have changed or if it is an old batch.
__label__1 NOT AS MY EXPECTATION AT ALL!: I thought it's a score book, just like "The Corrs / The Corrs", but I am totally wrong.
__label__2 Building up steam...: Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow.
__label__2 Great classic, many unreadable subtitles: This film deserves the excellent reputation it has earned. However the version I purchased (International Film Series) has white subtitles against white backgrounds. Only about 60% are fully readable. Other releases may have the same problem. Do not buy this unless you speak French.
__label__1 Looked cool :(: I am an avid ps2 gamer. I purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience. Was I ever wrong. The device has a battery indicator on it with 4 bars. When the batteries go down to 3 bars, I have a very sporadic connection to my ps2 (my ps2 is only 10ft away). After a while of playing Everquest Online, this became very annoying and inconvenient. After a month, I ditched this and bought a cable extender. Another expensive lesson. :(
__label__1 BALLS EVERYWHERE!: We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
__label__2 not just for the over 3 crowd: Santa bought this for my then 11 month old for his first Christmas. He and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells. (The cats do too.) I don't think you need to wait for age 3 as recommended. I do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already. I highly recommend this product, especially over the winter when it is wet and dreary here--it sits in our living room for oodles of fun.
__label__2 Great Product!!: I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys, (ages 3 and 6) love to play with it. It is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily. To use inside you do need lots of room. It can be put together or taken apart in less than 5 minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you don't have room to always leave it up. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw.
__label__1 Flimsy and Seams Coming Apart: I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly), there are a couple holes in the material, 2 forgotten attachment loops, and it is rather flimsy. Kids still like it, though it isn't going to last too long.
__label__1 You call this a mystery?: I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer, good describer, but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action, in this book at least, is predictable and rendered downright boring. All the lurid details that are supposed to add to the "psychoerotic" nature of the book come off as crude and off-putting instead, like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken. And anyone who can't guess the "surprise twist" by page 25 wasn't reading very closely.
__label__1 Disappointed!: Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose, this book overall was a big disappointment to me. He did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel, and left too many loose ends. Each time I expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence, he didn't bother to tie it in. I think it's possible that he didn't even know how it would end until it did, and at that point he was just tired of writing. If you decide to read this book, be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value, and be prepared to be left wondering . . . "what ever happened with the ______ ?"
__label__2 Great for 18 month old and 4 year old!: My girls love this. It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well. I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead. The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.
__label__2 Lost Balls....Found?: Nice book, not quite as good as I expected but had some really awesome photos! AC
__label__2 Great toy but Hard to turn off: A review from a kid.: pro's :great fun, portable.con's: hard to read LED except in darkness ,no off button.As soon as I got this toy I started playing it.but then ,I found out that in bright light I could not see the LED so I went in some shade.Now thats just fine except theres no shade indoors!so I found a dull light and used it.But then I brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so I had to play it though.But overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient, buy this product.
__label__1 Not like the ones I've seen--not as good: Instead of being a better product, this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesn't respond like the "older" versions. Aren't things supposed to get better? This one is made in China--where all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed with/sabatoged?Wish I'd gone into a store and looked at it, held it (this one is lighter & not good quality) and the color is dark (not the bright red or blue I've always used/seen) and hard to read the text, too.Would have sent it back, but for the shipping costs (which ran up the price).
__label__2 My kids & all their friends love this game!: My 7 & 9 year olds love this game - and we have gotten it for all of their friend's birthdays, too. They love trying to come up with items to stump the computer... it keeps them busy and gets them thinking.
__label__2 It's Grrrrreat!: My wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends. It's fun to think of an object (20Q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things) and answer it's astute questions and it usually gets it right. Sometimes it has to go on to 25 questions though. Kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Classic, unadulterated Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls.: This is where it all started for many Kelly fans. It's wonderful stuff--Paul's lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry. The musical style is unashamedly lusty-boy pub-band, unsynthesised (I remember when music was real....) and relentlessly cheerful. Every tune on this album is catchy, and even the dark ones are uplifting. "Dumb Things" was the anthem for pre-gen-X, post-baby-boom lost souls. Kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days, but his story telling has always been strong.Under the Sun is unmistakably Australian, more so than on later albums. This is particularly obvious on "Forty Miles to Saturday Night" and "To Her Door". When Kelly writes about things Australian, he gets it right. There is emotional truth in the detail here, and the music is damn good. Kelly deserves his status as an Australian working-class (anti-)hero. CB
__label__1 ...: The music on this set is fine, as Ms Day always is. However it has a quirk I find distasteful. On the third cd is a hidden track, track 13 to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it. I wouldn't recommend buying this for that reason alone. All the songs are available on other cd's so it's no problem skipping over this one. It seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere.
__label__1 Nice instight hidden in the pages: The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes), cognitive learning, values, culture, goals, working with tools, and communication. The diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at all; sometimes you wonder if diagrams like figure 1-3 on page 23 is downright necessary to have there. I felt like parts four and five of the book really dragged on unnecessarily, especially the chapter on organizational engineering. It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300. I think that Hoemann had a lot of potential in this book when I first saw it, and I was let down. Another nice thing would be for him to drop the plethora of coined-terms. Overall, there is some really nice thoughts in here, but there is a lot of unnecessary things that you have to thumb through.
__label__1 Too much money for too few channels: This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk...
__label__2 Best Book on VB.NET I've Found: This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET. It is well written, and offers excellent perspective on VB.NET and .NET Framework, with enough detail so that the reader (together with some hands-on experience) will have a good depth of knowledge when he's finished. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Obfuscation of even the most trivial slices of code: Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money.
__label__2 Great cookbook: I purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in Trinidad. He was not able to buy a cookbook while there.I searched Amazon and bought the one and only Trindad cookbook, and it was a winner! He was very pleased that the recipes were for a lot of the food that he experienced.
__label__2 One of the best books of all time: This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images, the developing of the characters, Betty Smith is a master at her art. Francie and her family come alive in this book. I've read it over and over and I still love it. I would recommend it for anyone from high level 4th grade readers to elderly people. What an amazing story!
__label__2 touching: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends. When Betty Smith wrote this book, she looked back on her life and the experiences she had, and put some of them in her book. It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up. If you miss A Tree Grows In Brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel.
__label__2 An Awsome book that you must read!: Francie is a girl who is dirt poor, and living in Brooklyn during harsh times. Francie is strong through the horrible things that happen to her during the course of her life. I cried, I laughed, and I felt the pain that Francie felt. Francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death. Not to mention almost being raped. This book also deals with a girl becoming a woman. A must read book!!!!!
__label__2 Three Thumbs Up!: I give this book three thumbs up! It is poinent, funny, sad, romantic, and scary all at the same time! It is a classic that will keep readers on their toes for a million years!
__label__2 Fantastic reading: I have read " A Tree Grows In Brooklyn" over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult,I read about the life of Francie Nolan and realize I can overcome any problem with the same determination that Francie and her family had. All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived. I would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age stories.I have read "A Tree GrowsI have read "A Tree GrowsI have read "A Tree Growsin
__label__2 It's not hype!: This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say "I told you so".
__label__1 A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic.
__label__2 Saw the: movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read.
__label__1 A Classic?: I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
__label__2 A Lifetime Favorite: My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
__label__2 Great book, good condition: Loved the book! Read it in 5 days. The condition was as advertised by the seller. Would recommend it to other people.
__label__1 Credit Cards Will Not Fit: All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
__label__2 It's both gorgeous and a good read: This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months, and I finally had to write a review that disagrees with the previous negative ones. There's no nice way to say this, but maybe there is a new money-old money difference in perception here. What I see in the book is one gorgeous and highly livable room after another. Lively, vibrant, personal and comfortable homes obviously used by real people. What I didn't expect was that I would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as I did.
__label__1 Dissappointing at Best: The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly, I can find better photos and design insite from magazines than what I found in this book. It's easy to understand why there are so many people wanting to sell the copies they have. It is honestly a disppointment if you are used to truly inspiring design publications. If you decide to buy this book, do yourself a favor and purchase a used copy. Even at Amazon's reduced price it's still over priced for what you get.
__label__2 A Story Everyone Must Know...: Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley, a young girl who was rescued from a dysfunctional home during the 1970s by a system that ultimately failed her. Nova explores her journey from Hell to Limbo in an unforgettable documentary that shows the darkest sides of humanity and the captivating innocence of a child. You too will be haunted by this beautiful girl whom everybody simply referred to as Genie.I would so love to own a copy of this DVD!
__label__2 Well Worth Acquiring!: Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers, a duet with flutist Elise Wood (a sensitive version of Duke Ellington's "Star Crossed Lovers"), a trio rendition (with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III.) of "Mood Swings," with a quintet (a blazing version of "My Shining Hour" that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos) and five selections with the full sextet. Four standards follow six obscurities (including Charles Mingus' "Diane"). Hicks, who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner's voicings, has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him. Due to the variety of moods, instrumental colors and settings, the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring.
__label__2 "Conversation" video: I bought this video for the "Conversation" video where Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams Jr. are playing their guitars, singing, and sharing whisky. I like when they raise their whisky glasses to each other. This is a comical, well put together video with Robert Duvall. I like the 3 videos that tied together like a mini-movie... EVERY WALON JENNINGS FAN SHOULD OWN THIS GREAT VIDEO!...
__label__1 Not What I Expected: I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However, the disappointment was great other than Gretchen Davis. I've been a fan of Kristofferson for 35-40 years and that could be the problem. There are very few people who can sing his songs - Johnny, Waylon, Willie, and Kris. I far preferred and really love the "This Old Road" CD.Donna
__label__1 How did Brian Mcknight and Russell Crowe get on this CD: I couldnt wait to hear this CD cause i love Kris Kristofferson and his work. many of the names on the CD were great and some great singers came out to do triButes to Kristofferson. Shooter Jenning's "Silver Tongue Devil and I" is amazing. Willie Nelson's "The Legend" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on "Why Me" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's "Darby's Castle" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity "Me and Bobby Magee" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of "Me and Bobby Magee" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged.
__label__2 Hooray for Doris!: These two albums have been (thankfully) put on one CD. Doris is at her best here, particularly with sassy renditions of "Cheek to Cheek" and "Easy to Love." The title song, with its slow beginning to its jazzy ending, is sung by Doris in an ironic and humorous manner; even the composer admits that her rendition of "Horray for Hollywood" is the best version by any singer. On Volume 2, she sings wistfully of "It Might As Well Be Spring" and "Three Coins in the Fountain" as well sings coyly "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm." Also, "Over the Rainbow" and "Blues in the Night" are stand-outs.
__label__1 Strangely compelling, but not really all that great: I gave this book two stars because of its original approach to an old idea. The zombies in this book (called "bodies." The z word is never used.) were different enough to draw my attention.Unfortunately, that is really all this book had going for it. The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies. I was told over and over that the survivors were afraid, but I saw no compelling reason for that.If you do decide to try this book, because of all the (wtf) 4+ reviews everywhere, I recommend you (a) get it from the library and (b) stop at book one.
__label__1 Save your money, don't buy this dryer.: I bought this dryer on October 15, received it on October 23 and on November 9 the plug started to overheat and burn after 5 minutes of use. The settings at which the plug started to smoke were: medium speed and hot temperature. Also, I did not use it daily... as you can see nothing too harsh or unexpected for a hair dryer. I am returning it to Amazon ASAP and hope I can get my money back. I don't want a replacement... one bad experience is enough for me. Just as a hint if you are thinking of buying a Vidal Sassoon dryer: If their products have so many negative reviews and unsatisfied costumers it is not a coincidence, obviously the Vidal Sasson brand has serious quality management issues. I thought about this, but went an bought this dryer any way. I was a sucker for the price and free shipping I should have just gone with my initial mistrust and bought something else. I hope this does not happen to you.
__label__2 Really good miniseries, but Amazon let me down: I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle.
__label__2 A necessary if unpleasant reading experience: Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's "Pictorial Key" is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the "uninitiated" astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary
__label__2 Excelent: This is the second time I bought the same book from Stamatis.The first one I gave to one friend. He push me do give it as a gift.This second edition is far better.
__label__1 every since i saw one on tv: every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
__label__2 Good System: I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area, which is the important part. I don't know that I would hook it to a siren but I'm very happy with the system. Instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged. I plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night. I did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor. It's a good 120' away and the base unit is inside a brick building in an interior room (2 walls). It picks up all traffic in the drive. Good system for the money.
__label__1 Voice alert system 6: I am sorry that I ever bought this thing, it is the most annoying "toy" I have ever bought. No matter where I put it or how I adjust it, it goes off all night long. This would be a great gadget in theory if we lived in an animal free (No squirrels) and bug free (no flying beetles, moths & etc.) world but seeing how that is not the case, it's really not good for anyone. Even the shadows of people and cars set this thing off. I thank god that I didn't buy two alert systems as I originally planned.
__label__2 Great Puzzle: Although it took a long time to receive this puzzle, it was worth the wait. My kids love trying to figure out how to maneuver the vehicles to get them to a building. I would recommend this for children over 2. It takes a lot of fine motor coordination to move the vehicles.
__label__1 Too much sex!: Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote "alternative" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger.
__label__2 First prize.: This book has found a permanent spot in my home, namely, on my desk, where I do all my hobbies. It has loads of great ideas that I've already used. Can't wait for the author's next book --apparantly its a sourcebook on animal designs.
__label__1 Do Not Buy: This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
__label__1 a total rip if you own "Music has the right to children": If you already own "Music has the right to children" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with "Music.." becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones, there is no re-mixing at all. But, there is one exception at the end they play a 2 minute bit that gets you excited but then ends. This is hardly worth 12.99 so looks like you and me are gonna have to wait until BoC makes a new album. Awwwwwwwww hurry up guys!
__label__1 Violence Bonjour?: How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book? Having rather enjoyed Deja Dead (the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month), I just couldn't finish Death du Jour. I found it a rehash of the other with more blood and gore added and even some sex - wowee! It made me long for a good old romantic historical novel - where have they gone?
__label__2 Watch Out for Those Bones: Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner, she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about. In addition her character Temp Brennan finds herself in the midst of people who's deaths have been quite mysterious. Death Du Jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a Saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship. Temp Brennan isn't just a laboratory investigator. She is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it. A fascinating world and a well told mystery.
__label__1 Dull, flat writing kills the fun: Gore yes, lots of information about autopsies and assorted other matters, rather too-clearly-fictitious characters ... It all adds up to a rather flat, dispiriting formula effort. If you just HAVE to know who's responsible every time you read of a fictitious killing, then you'll get through this, otherwise it becomes rather a drag.
__label__1 Awful!: This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious, but worse than that, the writing was simplistic and choppy- very hard to read. I always finish books that I start and this one I almost put down. I only finished it, by skimming because the reading was so choppy, because I had already bought it and couldn't return it. No character development, no characterization of the characters at all, and the dialogue is flat and boring and only serves to advance plot. Descriptions don't describe-they tell in short sentances, or they lecture. I'm a scientist and I found this book boring and annoying!This is my second Reichs novel. The other was better, but I won't be coming back. Save your money and your time!
__label__1 What is your definition of good?: Readable and missing no pages? Wow! I was in the book business a long time and this paperback I received was not in "good condition:" it was dog-eared, had water damage and cover damage. Good thing it was only a paperback and quite cheap. Paperbacks were essentially intended to be like the newspaper, read and discarded. This one, perhaps not discard in this day and age, but definitely not resold. Like I said, good thing a paperback and my "Author Du Jour," because otherwise I would have been p*****. However, it did arrive in record time: 2 days, I think.
__label__2 Good, but...: I really liked this book and I love the main character of Tempe Brennan. The characters are well drawn and multi-dimensional and I loved all of the tidbits about forensics and anthropology. The locations were rich in detail and I felt like I was there. My only complaint about this book was that I had every single plot point figured out a good 30-50 pages before Tempe did. There wasn't a single thing in this book that surprised me. But it was still an enjoyable read and even if I knew that going in, I would still read it.
__label__2 Holy Grail Found!: I've been after the vinyl for these two albums for 10+ years....it is considered the holy grail of west coast (USA) psychedelia. I gave up and bought the CDs through Amazon. Better than I thought. An absolute classic and equal to the reputation. Years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation. Everyone I have played it to are equally high in praise.
__label__2 Too much is not enough: My boys, ages 5 and 7, can't get their fill of this colorful, wacky book. The love indulging their imaginations with it each night before bed and "sweet thirds and fourths" of it in a single sitting would not be enough if they had their way!
__label__2 A good collection: I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense, I'll go to a cattle auction. Originally a digital recording, it suffered from tape hiss which is odd for digital(the early days of)recording. The hiss is gone but the recording still doesn't sound right to my ears particularly the vocals. Suprisingly, this is a very short disc clocking in at a paltry 33.50. Another entire release could have easiliy fit on the remainder of the disc. I hate when labels cheat the consumer in that fashion. So be it, still worthwhile for some very good tracks. 10 tracks/full lyrics/33.50.
__label__2 Dreaming of more...: Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet, it's classic Lightfoot...Dream Street should have been one of his biggest sellers.
__label__2 Vivid descriptions and fast moving plot: Although it has been some time since I read this story, its vivid descriptions have stayed with me. The author does a marvelous job of describing the Southern California beach city setting, so much so that while driving on Sepulvida two months ago, I saw a drab three-story stucco commercial building and simply knew that it must be the building that houses the call-center. Also typically Southern Californian, the car chase contained endless minutes at a jam-packed intersection with the driver cursing himself for chosing the wrong route.Overall, Hotline is an entertaining story that keeps the pages turning.
__label__1 TERRIBLE!!: I have never entered a review before, but this book was so bad I had to stop you from wasting your time. I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go. The reviews were mixed, but I bought this book anyway because I run a call center and I thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me. Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through. I kept thinking the "real" storyline was yet to be introduced, or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming. Boring characters, unrealistic scenarios. I will never read another book by this author.
__label__2 THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!: This book is ultra-rare, so if you can get a copy, keep it. I stole mine from the public library. The book visits some of the old Spacer worlds from the Robot novels, and it is interesting to see how time has treated them. This book also provides incite into the WHOLE Foundation series! THIS IS A MUST!!!!!
__label__1 Too much: This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact, to get to thereal story, just skip to the last 40 pages. Boring.Long. It dishonors the enitre series.
__label__2 asimov is a genius.: Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book, I wouldn't be suprised if someone wasn't studying it today. Asimov's writing is compelling ... not too full of sci-fi babble which often sounds odd to readers 40 years later, and that makes it pretty timeless. Many older books constantly irritate me in this manner.
__label__1 Another one...: ...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me, you were expecting more 'sorry about tomorrow' then steer clear. This just wasn't *ahem* 'rocking' enough for my tastes - and felt like a real step backwards (contrary to the other reviews) I don't think they will return to their higher energy material, which for me is a shame, as I was a fan.
__label__2 one of the greatest TPB's of all time: If you like comic book deities even a slight bit, or even modern or ancient human deities, then this book is for you. Struggles are all of cosmic proportion. I love the reference to all Earth's ancient religion gods as gods who are but a drop in the bucket compared to some of the forces at work here. Even though its a comic book, it tells it like it is. Us, as human beings, can lay no claim to even comprehend the magnitude and sheer myriad of benevolent and malevolent forces that constantly struggle on planes of existence much higher than ours or any of our perceived gods. Religious zealots would do good to read this book and give them a better understanding of how small their religious texts are in the grand scheme of things.
__label__2 Great story, I am enjoying it: I have always been intriqued with guys like Thanos, Apocalypse, Galactus and so on. These is a great story about the mad power hungry thanos and the super heroes who have to stop him. I learn alot of things I did not know of Thanos. I have yet to finish reading the book, I am halfway there but I have to say I have loved it. I am not that big of a comics collector but I decided to buy this and I must say its a great read.
__label__2 This deserves to be an Animated Movie.: I had already read this story before I got the compilation version. Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view, he doesnt really see a good or bad in anything. The action is great and does make sense in the marvel universe. This story is meant for animation and would easily be on a higher level then the previous cartoon movies that have been released. The story of thanos getting the infinity gems is just as much fun as seeing him use them to mess with everyone including the cosmic beings.
__label__2 A Collector's Review: An Awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe.
__label__1 a patchwork, not a book: The authors have taken the opportunity to publish a book of which they wrote only a small portion. The plot progresses through the snippets of first-time writers. This book is not a part of the series but an attempt to milk the series for all it's worth. (See also Grantville Gazette I,II, III).Instead of a cogent style, the book is pieced together from snippets available elsewhere. As a result the book fails to tell a cogent story, forcing the reader to parse disparate language and editorial differences from section to section.
__label__1 Worst in the series thus far.: By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development, 200 pages of dry political education, and 100 pages on ballet recitals. Dry and pointless reading.
__label__1 Disappointing After the Really Great Work in 1632 and 1633: I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633, it was another gem. Things skipped a bit with The Galileo Affair, just a little too much sermonizing. But this latest, The Ram Rebellion, just stinks. Most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep, cooking, agriculture and whatnot. Now those are all fine things, but I bought the other books to be entertained with action+fantasy+history, in that order, not history+agribusiness+feminism. I am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve I will swear it off for good.
__label__1 Not so much: I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.
__label__1 I agree...just recieved today: This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back
__label__2 Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring: I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville
__label__2 I love this simple band: I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny.
__label__2 Decent: After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger, I decided on this one. This is the 4th ring I've tried. It fits nicely and looks fine with my small diamond solitaire. Has a good amount of sparkle but definitely doesn't look expensive. Don't let anyone look too closely!
__label__2 Back to the Movies: This product was handled and packaged fast, easy to open. Was very happy to fined this old movie to enjoy over and over again.
__label__1 Worthless: This stuff is a ripoff. I found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything. It does not. Go to the store and buy a 24oz bottle of cheap body wash and a 2oz vial of tea tree oil. Empty 2oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in. Shake well. Same thing only MUCH stronger and a fraction of the cost.
__label__1 Dangerous!: Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat, swollen glands, and you might not get the smell out of your nose for a few days. It needs warning labels, and testing.
__label__1 Disappointed: I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
__label__2 starblazers goood: i just picked up the dvd of the first 5 episodes and must say that the vhs version {by jupiter} was much smoother and cleaner than this {dvd} version. however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on 25 years now. so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up.AND SEND IN YOUR CARDS.
__label__1 America is Going Deaf: I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard. People need to stop and remember what real talent is, not this uncoordinated, bad singing group. Their music is as is they are making up the guitar riffs as they go, and I don't find it difficult to scream. So Glassjaw if your ever in need of a new screamer, I'm your man.
__label__1 The worst band ever: I've seen this band 2 times and believe me both times I wish they wernt on the bill. They are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you. Seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway.
__label__2 it DEFINATELY grows on you: at first listen, i was only impressed by cosmopolitan blood loss. but after listening to the whole cd a few times in my friends car i realized that this album had a lot more depth than i gave it credit for. in my opinion some of the stand out songs on this record are ape dos mil and cosmo blood loss. but each song has something to offer. you're not just going to get an annoying flow of screams throughout each song. there's a nice variance between the deep screaming and the switch to passionate singing which makes each song stand out. i would definately grab this album if you're fans of finch and the used. its worth your time.
__label__2 Beyond Excellent: I seldom *ever* find a book in my school library that is worth reading. This book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more. I'm hoping the door is open for a sequel, which I'd buy right away.
__label__1 The Transall Saga: The Transall SagaBy George MickcloudMark is a normal teenager who lives to be out in the wilderness. Mark goes on a solo camping trip through the desert when finds a strange blue light that when he touched it. It transported him to another planet and time. Now he must us every nature skill he ever learned to survive. Two years past and is now a strong dark colored man.

But some people don't like Mark and want him to leave. Mark now has a price on his head for his death. Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying. Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family?
__label__2 A Book I Actually Wanted To Read: This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!
__label__2 A Great Book: I was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final. I am not a big reader so I was upset about haveing to read. The day after I got the book I got sick and had to stay home from school. To pass the time I sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours. This book was exciting and although it was slow at first, when the story got going, I couldn't stop reading. The key character is Mark a young boy who is into hiking. His parents let him go on a hike in a desert and he promises to meet them at the other end of the desert. While Mark is setting up camp one night he sees a wierd blue light. He climes closer to it and falls into it. When Mark wakes up he is in a red jungle. He goes through a sieries of troubles such as quick sand and finding food before he finds other humans. Mark finds some great compainions and a great adventure!
__label__2 James Lee Burke-Dave Robichaeux series: This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series, the first being The Neon Rain. JLB is the definitive of Mystery/Crime writers when he developed the character Dave Robichaeux, a Cajun Homicide detective who started his career in New Orleans and eventually semi retired in New Iberia, LA. The stories are strong, sensitive, moral and above that hypnotic in a sense where you are in the story literally (if your hooked on it). Highly recommended along with his other series of books.
__label__1 Not worth the price: I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.
__label__2 Robin Trower - Putting It Straight: 1977 - Polydor RecordsSongs Include :Life In LondonGettin' BettaRunnin' From The FutureIt Ain't What It SeemsOff Beat RideLovin' YouDedicationSpeakeasy
__label__2 brings out the romantic in me: These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a "shot" in the romance department, one or more of these songs should do it.
__label__2 My new FAVORITE FACE WASH!: The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light, mildly fragrant, and deep cleansing. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized.
__label__2 Great Whodunnit!: A classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing. Watch for a spell-binding cameo by Stephen Herbster, virtually buried in the credits but more than worthy of praise.
__label__1 Sloppy research: Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations, his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research. For example, his key claim that "Little Round Top" was not known by that name until "years" after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago. Desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo-detective. He mentions with praise the research of photo historian William Frassanito, but doesn't seem to have actually read Frassanito's books very carefully. Desjardin's arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent, but contrary information
__label__2 love it... she's wonderful...: Ít's one of the best books I've ever read. Was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever... She's a very strong women and I like the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way, though I don't like the way she abandonnes her children all the time...
__label__2 Love these diapers - they don't leak!: Okay, the title says it all - these diapers just don't leak for larger babies. I love them and use them exclusively for our child at night (he's trained during the day) and have no problems whatsoever. They're a snap to put on and just are wonderful to use. I can't recommend these enough - I've tried so many brands and these definitely work the best. I have broken too many fingernails changing crib sheets from the results of cheap leaky diapers and so therefore, I highly recommend these diapers, and so do my nails!
__label__1 WHY DO WRITERS DO THIS??: This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin. He writes way too much about each individual film the actor's made up to the time of the book's publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them!UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
__label__2 This book is wild, wonderful, blatantly honest and necessary: If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did.
__label__2 Buy this book...if you love nature.: Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert, and life in general. This book should be mandatory reading for any present day backpacker or outdoorsman.
__label__2 Sums up my innermost feelings: I can't rave about this book enough, It was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class I took in college a decade ago and I've probably read it 20+ times since then. My copy is tattered, highlighted and written all over. Growing up in rural Utah I feel Abbey's pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas. I crave the solitude that he writes about, understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can't help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants. Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read.
__label__2 Nice: For what it is (an inexpensive tp holder), it performs great. Have had other brands, and it is built as good as any.
__label__1 Bring the old type back: At least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants
__label__1 I have three of these things--none of which work.: I am an old lady who doesn't throw anything away, thinking I might need it some day. Over the years, I've purchased three of Stern's sprayers, with high hopes that the newest one will finally work. Forget it. I'm finally dumping my hope and throwing them out. It's hard to believe that a functional one hasn't been designed.
__label__1 Lazy reproduction of an old book.: Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system, so you're basically paying for a very rough, poorly scaled photocopy of the old printing. No wonder it's not available on Kindle.
__label__2 An Elric novel written by Authors who grew up reading Elric: I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy, inspiration and satisfaction as any book I have ever read. Elric was the first "evil" hero. Every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters. Drizt Do'urden is a shadow of Elric. Raistlen is almost an exact copy of Elric. Darth vader's sinister life, dependence on technology/sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of Elric. In this book so many authors who wanted to write Elric stories, some who had made great fame and fortune copying Moorcock, were given licence to write as they pleased. Every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about Elric. My highest praise: I want a sequel.. or two... or ten... a series published monthly untill I am old and grey.
__label__2 fantastic pix of TEXAS: Beautiful pictures... excellent photographs If you want ton see Texas this book is it......
__label__1 Pure Dissappointment: I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be. I purchased it as a child and own it now as an adult. However, the only reason I do own it was because they attached their videos on DVD. We like it (Wild & Loose) and Juicy Gothca Krazy are great songs but only in there video forms. If you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on CD you aren't going to find it. Sad to say but I feel the only reason this album really sold was because many saw the videos first and then purchased the album hoping to hear the same thing.
__label__1 Trouble: We have trouble with the electric anchor, The cord tends to backlash and ties itself all around the wheel. so far it has been a battle. Nothing like we expected. If I could I would return it. Great idea not such a great thing.
__label__1 Im with Jim: The pedals fell off, the seats broke off. The bikes looked great and we we're psyched about them, easy to put together, nice fat tires for our play yard, but in a matter of weeks they were unuseable and off to the bike repair shop. Not a good deal at all!
__label__1 Boring: The problem with this book, is that you cannot argue for copyrights on one hand, and against them on the other. Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity. The thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it.
__label__2 The most beautifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns: This is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns ever published. Every page is a visual & mystical treasure.I reccomend it to any & all seekers of light on the subject of Unicorns.
__label__2 Relieved the fifth season was finally released!: I had bought all the DVDs up to season 4 and was dissapointed that they stopped issuing the seasons. All in al, the features are the same as the other seasons and the dvd's are a must have for any fresh prince fan!
__label__2 Hilarious!: I absolutely love the Fresh Prince, and buying this season was a great investment! I personally think Season 4 is the best, but this one is a close second. Also, Season 3 has bloopers at the end of every episode that I love, but I don't believe any of the others do...which is a little disappointing. Regardless, I will be buying Season 6 soon!
__label__1 Picture Looks Much Better Than Product: If I had opened the box before I gave the Club Champ Putt 'n Return Putting Mat as a gift, I would have returned it. Disappointed in the quality and durabiity. Would not recommend.
__label__2 An Easy Read; It's implementing the guidelines that's tough: Clear, simple, easy-to-read style. Many of the steps are obvious in retrospect. The book merely raises your awareness of the steps so you're more likely to use them
__label__1 Disappointed: Although the subject matter was interesting, the lack of pictures and overall layout of the book made it tedious to read. I saw so many opportunities for this book to be better. For example, there were many instances where an accompanying picture would have clarified a description or put it into a better context. A specific example of this is where she mentions a nail belt. It would have been illuminating to see a picture of one on that page. The writing style to me seemed dry, almost "textbook".
__label__1 Disappointing: This is a fascinating subject, but Kuhns makes too many mistakes in areas I'm familiar with for me to trust there are none in areas I'm not. Her discussion of pagan culture is muddled; she collapses together customs of different centuries as if all pagans of all places and times were interchangeable. The book also shows signs of having been spell-checked by computer.
__label__2 Very nice set especially for the money: Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
__label__2 Clear and tremendously helpful!: I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources, and this book has clarified much of the grammar I was confused about. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, but for those who need to clarify Arabic's overwhelming grammar rules and review and organize what you may have learned in your courses, it's tremendously helpful. Its layout is simple and straightforward, and the exercises are helpful too.
__label__1 What a stinker: How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted, I'm not a teenager, but I hope that even teenagers have brains enough to recognize a dog when they see one! The only reason I viewed this film is because of the previews, they were pretty comical. But three or four scenes don't make a movie. What's wrong with screen writers these days? Whoever wrote this must have been related to some one in upper management, otherwise it would have never been produced. The writer should have smoked the script, it would have saved us all some money.
__label__1 Dude whens it over: This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
__label__2 I wish i could give it 100 stars.. because i'm cool: what a hot film. so intelligent, so provocative. buy it. now.
__label__1 Dude, Where's My Car?: Fox has provided Dude, Where's My Car? with a great DVD package that consists of excellent picture and sound quality, along with a handful of cool extras that are sure to please fans. For those who have never seen the film, I recommend a rental if you're a fan of "stupid" comedies, as it is a fairly funny and entertaining flick. 2 stars.
__label__1 Pointless....: This movie was just dumb, but some parts were funny that why it got 2 stars. It seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next Bill & Ted...but you know that's not gonna happen.
__label__1 RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!: I was very dissapointed by this movie. It did not do well at the box office, and everyone else I know who saw it, did not like this movie. The story and all the characters are quite stupid.Everyone has a different sense of humor so I won't tell you what is and isn't funny, but due to popular opinion you may want to borrow or rent this movie if you intend to buy it.I am not in the bussiness of giving poor ratings, but I hope I can save you a few bucks.
__label__1 It is dumb: I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything, even to rent it) and found it to be quite stupid. I love movies like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Bill & Ted, and this is no where close to any of these. Contrary to other reviews, the only funny parts I found were the tatto scene (saw it 100 times in the commercials, but still laughed at it, when he draws it out--"Suuuuuweeeet! What does mine say?") and the bubble wrap parts. The Chinese restaurant scene was so not funny it actually made me mad.It gets two stars from me because I saw it for free after a long day with a sick child where I jsut wanted to get away from reality for a hour or two--it did accomplish that, but only minimally.
__label__2 Dude!!! Sweet!!!: This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.' But along the way things don't go as planed. It's a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Sean Scott. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!
__label__1 ehhhhh: I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing "next track" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good, but the rest make up for it. Ugglor|Mossen might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. The rest of the cd can't compete though. The reason this album earned 2 stars is because this song is on it.I've reviewed a number of cds and box sets... if it's great GOA you're looking for you get you movin and groovin, go other places. It may be a great album for some of you looking for a unique sound that unmatchable (like I thought it would be), but I can't say I'm satisfied.
__label__1 Trinity: This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed, not with deliver or anything just the content of the video itself.
__label__2 Newspapers are still a rag: "Infamous Scribblers" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up, and the infighting of politicians and printers, among themselves and with each other. It brought out things about our founding fathers that aren't in your regular history books. There is a very great likeness of events and people then and now, The one big difference today is newspapers don't attack like they did then. They didn't hold back much at all and would keep it up and not backdown. Give it a try I think you will enjoy it....Ken
__label__2 Very Fun Racing Game: Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.
__label__2 Autumn, The City - ZOMBIE EXTRAVAGANZA!!!: This book was a great follow up to David Moody's first book in his Autumn series. The virus that has taken over the world has hit The City - plenty of new characters and twists and turns. Even though most zombie books are predictable, David Moody gives an exciting and new experience for zombie lovers. You almost feel like you are there... This book is hard to put down - when you get to the last 20 pages, you just want it to go on, and on, and on... Shame that David's Autumn series is not able to be purchased at book stores in Australia though, which means you have to pay a LOT OF MONEY for one book - BUT the books are Totally Worth It!!!! I LOVE the Autumn series, and cannot wait to purchase the next books in his Autumn series!
__label__1 Not First Printing: I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line, it says first printing. I guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher. Ripped off. I will not buy anything by this publisher again.
__label__1 The worst book I have ever finished!!: I can't believe people really enjoyed this book. It was tedious and dull. Nothing new happened once the stage was set. Of all the "zombie" reanimated-body books and movies, this has to take the cake as the worst, bar none. No character development at all. Nothing to make you care about any of the characters. No explanation or even conjecture about what the f_ _ _ has taken place. Just rotting flesh and shuffling bodies.
__label__1 I am now avoiding Moen faucets!: We had a Moen kitchen faucet with a "lifetime warranty." It is junk. It started dripping after 5 years, and the exterior actually started rusting.When I tried to replace the cartridge, the screw was so cheap the head partly disintigrated and required an extractor. I could go on...Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting quality when they advertise "lifetime warranty."In fairness, they sent a new cartridge, but what I want is quality in the first place.It will last a lifetime --as long as you don't live more than five years!
__label__2 If things were perfect, this album would be among them: Moby is more than a genius of techno, he is a genius of music. What he does in this album is so joyful and depressing simultaneously, I just want to listen to it over and over again. The best tracks are Porcelain, Why does my heart feel so bad?, Southside, Natural Blues, and Run On. And the rest are still amazing songs.
__label__2 A MASTERPIECE of Electronic Music: This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten. I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now, but I have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums. This CD is one of those CD's you want to leave on repeat all day, and listen to it through and through. On this album Moby remixes a lot of old blues songs, and briliantly brings them to life. He takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album. If you don't own any Moby, start here. And if you love the smash hit "Porcelain" or "Everloving" you'll want to check out his album "I Like to Score" as another great Moby CD to own. If you haven't started listening to Electronic music at all START HERE!
__label__2 Excellent: Moby's latest album touches on many genres of music, and it sounds fantasctic. Instantly recognisable tunes hit you, and no wonder companies are queueing up to have his music play on their adverts. One of the best things about play is the number of songs on the album, a massive 18! It is guarenteed that everyone will like most of the tunes, because of the contrast in styles. If you buy one album this year, MAKE IT THIS ONE
__label__2 Great CD!: Very good CD, it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping. It have one or two "bad" songs but the rest are top quality. "My Weekness" always makes me think and put me in good mud. And if you enjoy the essays of Moby, then you'll love it! I advice you to buy it...
__label__2 Moby Continues His Great Style: The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music, and he certainly doesn't disapoint on this great album. One thing that Moby has, is a unique sound. He will never sound old, or his style of music will never be used by others, because no one could copy Moby. It isn't Rock, nor techno. it's something in between On this album, all the songs are strong, but in particular I think the song "why does my heart feel so bad" is the best. It pours out the most emotion without a doubt. It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down, and was used perfectly. Overall, if you are a fan of Moby, Buy this album!!
__label__1 Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic!: Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold, synthetic, superficial beats, create an unsettling tension that sounds unintended. He should be made to leave his room and go out and get some exercise.
__label__2 An album for Christians and non-Christians alike.: You can dance, groove, bob your head and be touched emotionally all in one sitting. This CD simply rocks!
__label__2 he gets it right: Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop, techno, rock but where it really shines is the bluesy gospel/electronic fusion with the awesome tracks Natural Blues & Run On, yes I love the blues but you don't have to be biased towards any particular type of music to enjoy this album as it cleverly mixes most genres. Easily 5 stars as I can't think of any weak points on this.
__label__1 moby = genius ¿? why ¿?: People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, ¿?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!
__label__1 There is NO way this CD is one of the best of the 1999: I purchased this CD because everyone is raving about it. I mean I ever heard about it on a night time sitcom...but whatever the case, I found this CD a utter disappointment. granted there are a couple tracks that I thought were okay, but the rest of the CD was a waste. I mean what is going on with the chanting. The bottom line here is people loved this CD becasue it was new, not that it was great.
__label__2 Results IN: Moby pulls off the album of the year.: I am not even done listening to every track yet, yet I know this is the one. Moby pretty much pulls off the album of the year. Artists of the likes of Madonna and Beck will be calling this guy for some of his expertise. He has broken ground by creating a beautiful unexpected hybrid: Gospel/Blues and Electronic music. Forget Fatboy Slim, or Slim Shady or Will Smith, get with Moby, and get with him now. "Play" not only rocks your mind, but touches your soul....All without putting you to sleep, being illegal, or selling you out.(Headphones recommended)
__label__2 let's play: This was my first Moby CD and I brought it for my fiance's birthday. We both love it! We have brought the CD Wait for me and Last Night since then. Moby knocks the socks off of Lady G
__label__1 New Age Muzak takes a (Hip) Hop: Why isn't this guy on the Wyndham Hill label? Lightweight music and, in the liner notes, lightweight musings. Not necessarily bad, but I don't own an elevator.
__label__2 A very good cd: This is a very good cd you should buy it! My favourite songs are Why does my heart feel so bad,Porcelain,guitar flute and stings and 7 although almost all songs on the album are good!
__label__2 remix: I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com.
__label__2 MOBY'S TITLE SIMPLY SAYS IT....PLAY: A really good CD....I wouldn't classify it techno, but great pop...It has it all dance rock, slow, medium....my favorite cut is "Bodyrock"...gets my butt of the couch and rock...I was surprised to see it as the theme song now to "Veronica's Closet" on NBC...you should catch the intro on the show, it is pretty rockin!....Any way back to the album, other great songs are the ambient "My Weakness" and the soul full "Run On". Catch this CD soon, it will fit all tastes.
__label__1 Never received it!: I'm sure if I had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent, I would have loved it. I returned the map and asked that the light be sent as originally ordered. This never happened and I ended up asking for a refund.
__label__2 Loooooooooooove this book!: I read this book over 13 years ago, and I tell you, it still remains one of my faves. Even though I was barely 13 when I read it, the book gave me hope and made me believe that anyone could become something, no matter their background and especially like Emma's.
__label__1 The loudest stealth ever: Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth. Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud. Apparently they've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers.FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one. Buy it amazon or B&M; or better yet, just stay away.
__label__1 I'm glad I'm not the only one....: This phone was fantastic for about 8 months. I could go about 100 yards from my house while talking without any interference. However in the last month the handset started "Channel Searching" no matter how close I was to the base and how good the signal. Two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since. I have done everything I can think of including change the battery and it continues to search and while it searches the answering machine doesn't seem to work. Oh well, no more Sony for me.
__label__1 Ditto, don't waste your money: We've had this telephone for about one year, and we love the features. However, we've had to replace the battery already (the replacement is very expensive, as batteries go). Also, the phone is constantly muting -- it makes a terrible clicking sound, too -- resulting in having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over. It must be channel surfing, but there is no need for this. I will be buying another phone, but not a Sony.
__label__2 Pretty good wipes, but a little thin: I have been using Pampers wipes pretty much from the beginning and I really love the pop-up tub and the different fragrances they come in. These sensitive ones are especially good for newborns. My only complaint is they are thin. I usually use 2 at a time, more if my son has a messy diaper. I recently tried Huggies wipes and they are thicker, but they don't pop up. I don't like reaching in the tub as much as a the pop up, so I guess I'll stay with these.
__label__2 True Corporate America: Probably the funniest movie about corporate America that I have EVER seen. From disgruntled employees to annoying co-workers, this movie has it all. A definate buy. If you enjoy movies like Caddy Shack and Princess Bride, you will love this.
__label__2 Satirical and funny...: I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester), and I saw this film a couple of weeks ago. The first ten minutes did not tell me anything good, since it seemed one of those low budget, "C" type, uninteresting comedies that invite you to switch channel.I am glad I didn't, because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations, a long discussion after the film was finished, and I saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses...Very recommendable, either to de-stress, or to realize that THAT (all the bad karma and nonsense by people who just want to control you and your life) is what you want to avoid, by all means. On the job, or in everyday life...
__label__1 Trying...: The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling "that would be great," stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again.
__label__2 Office Space Blu Ray Review: I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've seen the movie before. It's one of the best movies ever, and I won't even say what I paid for it on here because I don't know what they're asking for it now. I just know that I got an exceptional deal, I think it was a gold box or something. I'm looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about, but I did get a great price on this, shipping was fast through prime and I'm happy with my purchase.
__label__2 perfect christmus gift for manager or co worker: We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words "WORK SUCKS" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch.
__label__2 I Believe You Have My Stapler....: Ok, a few years ago, I worked for a major HMO last year. I was also confined to a small gray cubicle for 8 hours a day. And after watching Office Space, I quit a month later. Coincidence? Maybe. But it was like watching my life unfold on screen! Like having 4 bosses "remind" you about a tiny mistake that doesn't really matter, the doggone fax machine that is your sworn enemy, and of course the office FREAK, who you know is gonna someday show up to the work place armed! This movie has it all, and it's hilarious! So, if you ever get a case of the "mondays", call in sick,blow off those dang TPS reports, and watch this movie!
__label__2 love this movie: I bought this for a friend who had never seen it. I was going to let them borrow mine, but decided to just get them their own since it was so reasonable. Gotta love it!
__label__2 milton is the MAN: aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy. from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie. i have never even been inside a cubicle (thank god) and i think this movie may have influenced that. milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and HAS NO RED STAPLER??? *GASP* but anyway...anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line. this is a new CLASSIC in my book.
__label__1 Office Space: I ordered the movie Office Space, but when I received it I had Happy Gilmore in an "Office Space" package. It was sealed and everything. I was very disappointed in Amazon's service, in sending me the wrong movie! Will not do that again!
__label__2 Some of the funniest scenes, with an overall bland plot: I love this movie. It has so many individual scenes that are hilarious. The overall plot and story aren't the greatest, but I've found most people can over look this.This movie is rated R, and I think its one of the tamest R movies I've seen. There is brief nudity and a fair amount of swearing (mainly in rap music). However, the R rating may be for the best since I don't think anyone under the driving age will think this movie is all that funny. It's mainly work related and relationship comedy. I am thrilled to say there is no "bodily fluid" humor that has been in so many movies lately.The DVD features are almost nonexistant.
__label__2 That's greeeeat.: Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.
__label__2 Funny classic just like your were there: This one makes me laugh everytime, if you've ever worked in a cubicle you will appreciate the humor and the office politics.
__label__2 Cult Classic!: If you have ever worked in an office environment, you have to see this movie.I've watched this movie over 100 times and I still can't stop laughing.I still use quotes from this movie on a daily basis.
__label__2 Simply the best...: Yeah... I'm going to have to "go ahead" and rent this movie again because I missed most of it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line.Seriously though, this movie was simply the best movie I've ever seen. Other than the types of people the movie was being critical of, (mindless corporate suits and drones), I can't imagine anybody not loving this film.
__label__2 Life imitates Dilbert: If you've ever worked in a cubicle farm, spoken "corporatese," or dealt with downsizing, you'll find Office Space to be hilariously relevant. Created by Mike Judge of Beavis and Butthead fame, this movie could easily pass for a live-action version of the Dilbert cartoon. It pokes fun at everything from commuting to office birthday parties to "fast casual" chain restaurants. Watching Office Space, you will vicariously get the satisfaction of "sticking it to the man." Ron Livingston plays the lead role well, but the funniest characters are the supporting cast - Milton, Lundbergh, Drew, et. al. I'm going to need you to go ahead an watch Office Space...yeah...that would be great...
__label__1 hate it: this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
__label__2 This is the only movie I have watch over 5 times!: I love this whole movie! I is my all time favorite. I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it."Corprate Account Payable, Nina Speaking ...Just a moment!"I have been in a cube most my life and so much rings true....this is a celebrated movie and a tribute to all of us that work in the corprate world!I happen to like me work, getting there was a struggle...we all have been Peter Gibbons at one point or another in our career!"Hey Peter....Watch you Corn$%#"There are so many lines from the movie that just make me laugh. I know the budject for the movie was 10Mil..and I knowthat opening week it did 4mil...10 mill total...but the DVD is a cult classic...it must be reeling in the bucks!
__label__2 A Great Flick!: A must-see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment, hated work, got pissed-off at a printer, hates the boss, or feels trapped in a deadend job. The deliberate humor slaps you in the face from the get-go and continues to do so throughout the entire film. If you need a good laugh to forget the stress of your crappy job, then you need to see this movie.
__label__1 Get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy!!!: ... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas), it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time-.......A much better film in the same vein would be Bruce Robinson's HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING <Criterion Collection>(Executively produced by George Harrison)...Even some episodes of the Drew Carey show, and the old Mary Tyler Moore TV Series are better than this film!
__label__1 Busted DVD: I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen), the DVD would not play in any player I owned (which is 4). Tried to get in touch with customer service, but after a nightmare and a long headache I decided to just give up my ten dollars as lost and buy the film at Best Buy. Don't use this retailer!!!
__label__1 Not really that good...: When I started working in office (and a cubicle), all of my friends told me that I had to watch "Office Space" because it is so much like work and it's hilarious. Finally, I did get a chance to watch it... but I ended up being quite diappointed. Yes, there are some funny parts to the movie, but I was more disgusted with some of the supposed "humor." It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good). I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.Word of advice: I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents. Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all.
__label__2 Office Space (1999): This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell. This movie will get you to laugh. Especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work (preferably cubical style).
__label__2 Laughing at Ourselves: There are a lot of funny movies out there, but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes. "Office Space" fits this latter category, doing for the modern, post-1980 workplace what "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" did for the Arthurian legend. That is to say, "Office Space" has become a part of our common culture, with shared concepts like "pieces of flair" and "Is this good for the COMPANY?" being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us.Further, "Office Space", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits. They do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders. To see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of "Office Space." It's a classic.
__label__2 So real it hurt: The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses. Our company had just hired "efficiency consultants" to "analyze" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.
__label__2 NOT just another space shooter: When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man, I still will never forget the looks on their faces when I showed them how the game ran and just overall was a masterpiece of graphics and gameplay for it's time anyway. So your saying, yeah well what's the story with this game? Well, you start out as a GTA pilot (Galactic Terran Alliance) fighting a 14 year war against the Vasudans. The AI is impressive as is the combat animations and cutscenes. All I can say to anyone considering buying this is to get it before it is no longer made considering it's age. Enjoy!
__label__2 Works great, holds the phone, cool looking (for a charger): I hate the phone charger business, and have gone through piles of third-party chargers over the years. With my A310, phone chargers would just fall out. So far so good with this one, plus the glowing tip (besides just being neat-o) makes it easy to find. I wish there was a way to tell top v. bottom in the dark, but that's not really a problem (and I've never had a charger that did).Highly recommended.
__label__1 Mother Night: Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
__label__1 A bit disappointing.: It's vintage Vonnegut, but doesn't bristle like Slaughterhouse 5, B of Champions, or Galapagos. If you haven't tasted the genius of KV, I'd suggest pushing this one to the edge of your plate until you've chewed on some of his other works.William Olson, author of Right on Time.
__label__2 Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better: Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and "Travels With Charley" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight.
__label__1 What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!: This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie. I still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time I see him. (I live out in the wilds of our Island, not in the town)
__label__2 the choices we have to make will always haunt us: a brilliant character study of an upper middle class jewish german family who escape to kenya in the days before world war 2. having to adjust to a different world, having to learn to confront her own racism (irony of ironies), having to face up to a marriage where she is unable to love as much as she is herself loved, star juliane kohler manages to give a broad and poignant performace, as does the rest of the cast, highlighted by sidede onyulo as the african cook who becomes confessor and friend to the family. let us be thankful that others got ahold of the source material before the likes of meryl streep found it. a great film, in my top 100.
__label__2 Great Movie!!!: A very compelling story about a boy and his colt, awesome heartwelming family adventure horse lovers will most entirely love!!!

__label__2 Good book, obnoxious author: The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better. A better, more generous book by a young man in the west is Wah-to-Yah and the Taos Trail by Lewis H. Garrard.Smallchief
__label__1 Hardly the Oregon Trail: This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list.
__label__1 Not a happy customer: This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product, they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within 30 days. Well is almost a month since I send the products back and I havent seeing no refund yet. I tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they wont return my calls or write. I also think that phone number given is fake, because nobody ever answers the phone.
__label__2 A Truly Loud Phone: I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother who wears two hearing aids. Not only can she finally hear me on the phone, but she can use it while keeping her hearing aid in her ear. She has not heard this well on the phone for over ten years. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1 Ho-Hum........: With all the great material in the WEA vaults, why Warner Music UK chose to package and release these also-rans is a mystery. The material has a boring sameness to it I am not used to in an Oldies Collection. Dee Dee Warwick, Darrow Fletcher, Barbara Lynn & Mary Wells are all outstanding artists that I normally look forward to listening to, but who you would not normally identify with the disco or pre-disco period of American music. The selections on this CD display these and other artists' work out of their normal areas of expertise. This one is surely going to a back shelf.
__label__1 Exploitation of sibling...: This book was terrible, it was an expolitation of his brother, and a shameless way to promote his other books. No matter the situation, the author found a way to make a reference to another book he had wrote. It was poorly written, and jumps around quite a bit. Don't waste your time or money on this book, or any book of this author's.
__label__1 Uninspiring Cd: The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire. Listening to these songs had to be one time only deal.
__label__2 This is Great!!!: I bought this for my husband to be for Christmas. He grew up with the F Troop and wanted this. He loves it. I am very happy with my purchase. Great entertainment and it is CHILD SAFE comedy.
__label__1 It's A Bust: Warning, this game does not run on Windows XP or Windows 2000.I bought this yesterday for $2.99 at the local computer store. Took it home, and tried to install it. First, the setup program wanted to install DirectX 7 on my system, whereas I have DirectX 9 already.Next, I start the game, and it crashes almost instantly. Check the box... it says "Windows 95/98". Since I have XP, I assume I'm OK. Then I check the Interplay web site... Aha! This game does not work on Windows XP. Well, for $2.99, it was a small gamble on my part to buy it. It might be a good game, but I can't tell you for sure.
__label__1 Good book bad Digitization: The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page, makes it difficult to read at points, definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in.
__label__1 Dull: I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book, but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull. I had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the first hundred pages or so. There wasn't much point in finishing it. I love long books, but this one was pointlessly so. Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot. I found myself skimming many of the pages without feeling I has missed out on anything important. Definately the sort of book you read only if there is nothing else around.
__label__2 Attention to Detail: The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise "who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx "Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw.
__label__2 Very Good: Pretty good. Like the DC version, very well done. But I really hoped to see more of the earlier artwork by the original artists for the older chartacters.
__label__2 Spans the Generations of Marvel Characters: A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties, Iron Man was yellow, the X-Men were blue and yellow, and Daredevil was black and yellow. Marvel sure liked yellow.
__label__2 this book is a marvel: MY SON IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WITH THIS BOOK ON CHRISTMAS, THIS BOOK IS TRULY WONDERFUL. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I RECIEVED IT VERY QUICK, AND THE BOOK IS JUST GREAT. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING SO QUICKLY.I KNOW HE WILL BE THRILLED TO GET THIS TO ADD TO HIS COLLECTION. THANKS MUCH AGAIN KATHLEEN SERWIN
__label__1 could have had more surfing: When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before.
__label__2 Review by: Christine Stevens: It has the episode Angel on it w/David Boreanaz...what eles do you want
__label__2 nice set of songs: THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE.THE SONGS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND ARE CLASSIC PERFORMANCES BY THE MOST CLASSIC ENTERTAINER OF ANY GENRE OF ALL TIME.IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A COLLECTION OF THESE SONGS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS SET AND ENJOY THE FEEL GOOD MUSIC.THERE IS ONLY ONE ELVIS .
__label__2 What I expected: These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set, good sound but lacking in the noise-cancellation department. The fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear. The switch for noise cancelling on/off is well located as it doesn't take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets. Basicly, everything one can expect from Sony for $41. (Since flying with them I would change this to a 3 review... they just didn't deliver much with the noise cancelling.
__label__1 Terrible Headphones: I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash, and these were on sale for $25. I figured they hold me over for a week or two. A minute into the first song I regretted buying them. First of all, they're ugly as all hell. The only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was $70. The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency, and there is no bass whatsoever. These are honestly terrible headphones. I should have gotten $15 sony earbuds, i would have been much happier.
__label__1 Another verbal window into the past: Once again,McDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However, compared to "Charming Billy", this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively, I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found. I actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all. While I would recommend Ms. McDermott's work, I would not recommend this particular book.
__label__1 Disappointed: I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side, it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers.
__label__2 Inspiring: I listened to this book on cd which I have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person. I loved C.S Lewis's Mere Christianity. It gives a educated view into why he believes in God and more specifically the Christian God. He is a great writer and the book is very intellegent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
__label__1 Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding: I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately, his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards. He comes off sounding like, as one of my psych professors was fond of saying, a "park-bench philosopher". Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of "logic" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith.
__label__1 Merely the same things rehashed: I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would.
__label__1 disappointing and childish: I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith, given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer. Unfortunately, what I found were the kinds of arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter. If you've thought critically about anything at any point in your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book.
__label__1 Quality works in poor quality packaging: For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last, it came today. What a disappointment! If the covers of these books last through more than one reading, I will be surprised. The covers are beautiful, but the quality is poor, and certainly not worth the $47.90 I paid for this set. I was looking forward to something that would last for years to come. Oh well, I won't be sending the set back, because I'm anxious to read these incredible works (the first books I will have read in several years). If this review was about C.S. Lewis, it would be five stars. But, this review is about the shoddy quality of this set, and hence the single star review. Buyer beware.
__label__2 The best explanation of the core of Christianity I have read. Fascinating.: It has been a while since I last got excited about a book, but this book inspired me. This book gives both rational arguments for Christianity and sound explanations of core Christian doctrines.
__label__1 Book: The book took a while to get here, and when it did, it was in rough shape for supposedly being brand new. I also discovered I could have bought it for $5 cheaper from another online retailer. Not too impressed with this purchase.
__label__2 One More Review!: Hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years. And no wonder! It's author did not become a Christian til in his 40's when he came, as he tells it, "kicking and screaming into the kingdom!"He's heavy weight intellectual (taught both Oxford and Cambridge) but able to write clearly for us commoners as well. The many copies I have given away over the years have gone to Christians who need a clearer understanding of their faith, as well as to nonChristians who need to understand that Christianity is quite intellectually respectable - and possibly even TRUE!
__label__2 Seeing the Truth in the Logic: For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking, CS Lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of God but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider Truth. Use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who God is.
__label__2 Great book: Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
__label__1 Why all the hype? A huge letdown.: In all fairness, I wasn't able to finish this novel. The author seems to have a singular obsession with things sexual to the exclusion of most of the important characteristics of a good story.If you like the theme of a woman's sexual liberation, read Chopin's _The Awakening_ or Lawrence's _Lady Chatterley's Lover_ instead. (Besides, the sex is much better in _LCL_.) In addition to tackling this controversial subject, these books are masterfully written and classics for all time.
__label__1 Not very enlightening: As someone who has a genuine phobia of flying I thought that this book might provide some useful insights. After about a hundred pages I realized that it was just a lot of lurid filth. It is a total con. I ended up throwing it off the train somewhere in the middle of Manitoba. Probably the biggest rip since the Neverending Story.
__label__1 A disappointing book.: The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off.
__label__1 Too thin: I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough, but regardless, they were way too thin. I have a pair of Adidas and prefer their dry-fit fabric over these. These are for sure a summer pant.
__label__1 Why do people like this?: The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking.
__label__2 Magnifique: Eurasia's most inspired duo.Flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future.Not for the faint of heart.
__label__1 FUTUREDOC: I have been through most of the test preperation books in the market, but this I was very optimistic upon coming to this book. The book itself is not written in a "user-friendly" manner, and the best parts of this book are the 3,500 word vocab list. The math section is very comprehensive, however, the questions are a lot harder than those found on the SAT, which eventually starts to discourage you. I verbal review sections are practically useless, and the strategies do not work. Once again, buy this book only for the vocabulary list, and then move on to some other book (such as kaplan, etc...). This list will give you the foundation to answer analogies and sentencecompletions but nothing more...The practice tests are quite useless, and are much harder than that found on the real SAT...Good luck on you test preperation
__label__1 Solid math review but lacks application for the SAT: Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also, dont plan to use this book to brush up your vocabulary - the included word-list provides you with only the meanings of the words and not with a sample sentence.This book might be suitable for usage in combination with 10 Real SATs or some other book that features more realistic SAT questions.
__label__1 Below average CD, I was left very disappointed: This is probably the worst CD Sawyer Brown has ever came out with. Out of the 11 songs, only about 4 are worth listening to. I recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this.
__label__1 a story hidden in words: Way too many names, Way too much detail.There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read.
__label__1 Aimless and self-absorbed: This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
__label__1 Could Have Been A Fun Movie For The Kids: With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor, this could have been a movie that I enjoyed with my children! HOWEVER, the sexual innuendo and outright poor language, as well as the girl-girl kiss and "crotch enhancement" received by the Stiller character makes this a movie that I'm tossing in the trash can. What a drag!
__label__1 Not worthy of One Star. If the Academy gave out Oscars for: Worst movie, worst acting, and worst script, this would win hands down. When it comes to lame, witless and downright stupid movies, Ben Stiller is on quite a roll. If you are not a teenaged boy, I recommend staying away from this one.Dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie, don't fall for it. The non-stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it's a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people.In my humble opinion, if you have an IQ greater than 12, don't bother with Dodgeball. Personally, I'd sooner watch a marathon of Paulie Shore and Carrot Top movies before sitting thru Dodgeball again, and that my friends, is saying something.
__label__2 Worth the price of admission: I dont know how anyone could not laugh at this movie. It seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor. I wasnt a fan of Ben Stiller until this move. He is very funny in it. Despite the focus on humor, it is not entirely predictable and has some suprises in store for the audience.
__label__2 Not Bad: This movie was really silly, but I thought it was quite watchable. I was impressed actually. I wouldn't mind watching it again. Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one. I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.The plot in this movie doesn't matter much. No one cares about it. This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs. Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin. There's a whole variety of goofy humor. My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though. There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all. I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie. Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.I'd recommend checking this out for a rental. Laugh at some parts and not at others. Go with the flow.
__label__2 Good read for CA students wanting to learn about their histo: I'm trying to locate the abridged version that I taught from in the 60s. It's out of print and I would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not-so-good readers now.If you find any please call me at 949-854-8889.
__label__1 rating the physical book...not the story: This book is an excellent story. Lots of California history..or better..Alta California as it was known in the era.BEWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BOOK !!!!! It is about 10"x11"...printing of the story is VERY!!!! pale.I will keep this....but have ordered an older, normal paperback version...similar to the one I left accidentally at the San Diego airport.Terrible size and print itself. Find another book of Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson....and be ready to want to go to Old Town San Diego.Michaelene Gon.
__label__1 Had to return it.: After I install this blower fan it made a loud ticking sound. So I thought maybe it was hitting something. I uninstalled in and ran the fan uninstalled. It still made the loud ticking noise. So I had to return it. The bad part was that Amazon deducted 7.20 from the price I paid for the fan because I did super saver shipping. I don't recommend buying this fan or any auto parts from Amazon.com since they don't stand behind defective products.
__label__2 Awsome!: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First, it allows you to keep the baby clean, because the bibsters are quite big. Second, they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet. And, third, no washing and a new, clean, spotless bib each time. Makes parenting a bit easier!
__label__2 10 Stars! By far our favorite toy!: This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer, sometimes he just pounds them with his hand. The hammer isn't that hard, so when he does decide to hammer Dad's head, it doesn't hurt that much :-) If your child is less than 1, it will take a few days playing with the toy before he/she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence (they LEARN the toy). If we had 1 toy to take with us on a trip, this would definitely be the one. Highly recommend.
__label__1 WTF ???: Video only?Absolutely no sound from this "NTSC" DVD.I tried it on multiple machines and several computers...No dice...the soundtrack is absent.You have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show.Not very satisfying...I'd rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band.just a bit pissed in Puyallup, WA
__label__2 Looking Back with Love: A tantalizing performance by Kathleen Turner. Anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great " what if" In this film Peggy Sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back ..there!Turner pulls it all off in grand style. The realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are. Nevertheless , viewing this film might provoke a " thought" journey because its done so well and with care. Watch for Leon Ames and other older stars.Written by Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner.
__label__2 It is like going back in time!: I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother, who I miss every day of my life. But when I am watching this movie, I am somehow with her again, even if only for a few moments. It also lets me be a 'kid' again...remembering a time long gone by, but never quite forgotten. For me, this is a movie sprinkled with tears but rich with wonderful memories of yesterday. Let's face it, we all would love to go back to a previous time and place, even if just for a moment. This movie is the next best thing.
__label__2 cutting edge: Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman, but considerably heavier. Have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill; they chewed through like it was pine. Have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts. You only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they're doing their job. Haven't used any on wood; seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those. I only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism. But I do like its bright size markings (sure beats stamped metal, which I can never read in weak light). All in all, I'm very pleased, and the price was GREAT!.
__label__2 funny girl: This is a very good movie. It is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again,
__label__1 Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education: This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it.
__label__2 Nice Book: Clean, neat, white,one, made of paper,the cover is shiny,with words,Is anyone getting my pointgood bye
__label__1 Had to buy it: I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
__label__1 lazy publisher: The edition of "Jude the Obscure" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published.
__label__1 jude the mundane: thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail.
__label__1 Not an easy read: I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it.
__label__1 OK products, HORRIBLE warranty service: If you purchase Millennium products by Farberware do not count on getting any satisfaction if you need to use the warranty. I sent in three pieces 5 months ago for what I was told was a 6-8 week process -- I'm still waiting, and every time I call I get a different line -- they are either incompetent or lying, or both. Decent products, unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware!
__label__2 The Origin of Betty Boop!: Helen Kane is the flapper who was the model for Betty Boop. When you listen to this CD, you can appreciate just how well Mae Questal, who provided the voice of Betty Boop, imitated Helen Kane. The music on this CD is great fun. Not only do you get to hear more complete versions of songs that Betty Boop sings, but there are also songs like "He's So Unusual" that Betty Boop should have sung.
__label__2 works good: Works great now I get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast I give the company and the steamer 5 star
__label__2 Combo Saucepot and Steamer: Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family, doesn't take up much room on the stovetop. Only concern is that the handles do get hot and you need to use a glove or towel to use the handles after boiling or high temps. I would recommend this pot to anyone in the market for mini-size soup/stew preparations.
__label__1 Be careful it's hot, very hot on the handles: I agree this is a solid cookware. But it is so hot on the handles everytime I try to remove it from the stove. I believe they can do something about the design of the handles. BTW, my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally. But this is super hot beyond my tolerance.
__label__2 Great Steamer: Got this mainly for veggies. Works great and fast. Very pleased with it. It could be a little bigger but can hold 4-5 servings.
__label__2 Excellent book!: To tell the truth I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my "joy" was not something to which I was willing to admit.John Piper doesn't disappoint. His books are deep which is exactly what I needed as there are just too many superficial books on various Christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one's heart. John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you. If you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you. Awesome book! If it is what you need then you will NOT be disappointed!
__label__2 great great great: I WAS LOOKING FOR INEXSPENSIVE HDMI CORDS FOR MY PS3 AND MY NEW HD TV.. WELL EVERYONE TOLD ME U HAVE TO GET MONSTER CABLES THERE LIKE 50$$$ BLAH BLAH BLAH...!!!! WELL I FOUND THESE AND THOUGHT HEY THERE CHEAP SO IF THEY DONT WORK OH WELL.. BOY I WAS WRONG THEY ARE GREAT.. THE TV IS AMAZING AND THE PS3 GAMES LOOK SOOO GOOD!!!.YOU DON'T NEED THOSE OVER PRICED MONSTER CABLES .THEY SHIPPED TO ME FAST.. I EVEN GOT THEM EARLIER THAN EXSPECTED.( I KNOW I WAS CHECKING MY MAIL BOX DAILY) .I WILL DEFINATLY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!
__label__1 Very poor quality for HDMI: After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360, and a year of using a Monster HDMI cable for my PS3, I decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another HDMI cable for my Xbox. After shopping around, and seeing the price and reviews for this cable, I bought it, and in all honesty, this cable is much worse than even my component cables. I tried a few different movies, and a few different games, all to no avail. Characters in my games are choppy, and pixelated, and all of the movies, even in HD quality are blurry. I decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my Xbox, and immediately noticed the difference. This is a poor cable and I would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen.
__label__2 Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.: The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type, not the regular ones) you'll also need the adaptor for audio OUT. I should have checked before, because the adaptor by itself is more expensive than cable and adaptor together, at least here in Amazon. Otherwise, no problem. Recommended, especially for the price.
__label__2 HDMI Cable: This HDMI Cable category 2 hasn't fail me at all. It works great, and displays up to 1080P! I highly recommend this HDMI cable.
__label__2 Great price--don't buy branded cables: If you can tell the difference between the images and sounds these cables transmit and those transmitted by more expensive cables, you're not likely to be reading reviews of this generic item. These work well for any HDMI connection--don't spend more than a few dollars per cable.
__label__1 Adult who enjoys Good Children's videos: This was very amateurish. Don't think it would hold even the attnetion of a child, no matter what age.
__label__1 The Last Unicorn VHS: Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying "Damn you, damn you!" The knight/hero character says "Damn." A troll type creature says something like "What the Hell, am I supposed to look at." and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom "woman tree" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass
__label__1 Can't Manage to think about it...: The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie, for one the DVD release was very poor, and some aspects of the film weren't made for children...or ANYONE, for that matter. There isn't really a point to this film, so DO NOT BUY IT!
__label__1 The Last Unicorn: If I could give this a half star I would. I bought this for my children to watch and I felt with a rated G rating that I was safe. How wrong I was. I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did. When the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all I see is the tree and her huge breasts. And the magician is stuck between her cleavage. The world is getting sick enough that I don't need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it. I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie. I think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children.
__label__1 I like Unicorns, but this? Blah!: The last unicorn stinks. You really shouldn't see it. Some people like it, but i think it's a bad movie and doesn't have really good characters. People who like it, like it. We all have different opinions.
__label__1 Great movie, shoddy DVD: The Last Unicorn was my favorite movie when I was a kid. The story is sweet, the animation lovely. I eagerly bought a copy on VHS when I saw it some years ago and awaited the release of the DVD with glee.Unfortunately, my glee was somewhat unfounded. While the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever, the DVD itself is shoddy work. The movie is only presented in fullscreen (though there was a widescreen laser disc available), there are no extras -- even the picture quality is less than outstanding.If you're looking to replace a worn VHS, this is certainly a good option. If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you.
__label__1 Fantastic Movie, Worse Transfer Seen DVD: I remember seeing the Last Unicorn when it was first released in the 80's and loved it ever since. The story should keep adults interested throughout, with a wonderful story about dreams, love and sacrifice. The voice acting is first rate as well as the soundtrack. Yet, the transfer onto DVD is the worst I've even seen, the opening titles are blurry, the picture fuzzy. One review questioned that it may have came from the master VHS. I would not even go that far, it's a very poor copy, as for the sound, if you have 5.1 surround, you'll hear music and the voices coming from all directions. I view my movies on a HDTV, and that's even no help. As for extras, there are none, not even a trailer. So should you get it? Its nice to have it added to my collection, but expect a poor VHS viewing vice the clear DVD.
__label__2 Fantasy or reality: I have always loved this movie and was so excited to learn it was on DVD finally. A wonderful cast and wonderful music. I could watch it again and again. I love it.
__label__2 A Truly Beautiful Film!: When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was "new and innocent." After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, "I forgive you."To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done.
__label__1 Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen: First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse.
__label__2 Untitled: I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
__label__2 Good movie: This is a great movie! I first saw it when I was about 6 and I still love it! Beware of the profanity! I recently saw it again and I was surprised to hear the bad language because of the G rating.
__label__2 AN ALL TIME CLASSIC: People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
__label__2 Next best thing to being in a Chicago blues club: Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites. My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died. Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs.
__label__1 Yet another version, another vocalist.: The sound musically is good. That's the only reason I give it one star. But for the vocals no stars. If you don't care who sings, then buy it. I regret buying this cd, because the vocals don't appeal to me. Take advantage of the "Listen to" songs when available. Unfortunately on this cd that option is not available. But many others do have it.
__label__2 Awesome drum for a crappy drummer.: This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box, a classic, beautiful design. I swapped the stock Weather Master heads for an Emperor Coated/ Clear Ambassador Reso. Also swapped stock snares for 42-strand wires. No complaints about sound from this beauty.My only complaint to date is the strainer. The standard P-85 strainer would often get snagged when moving the snares from off to on. This sucks big time when you're in the middle of a song, fighting with the strainer to co-operate. I got desperate and almost snapped the arm off it once. This may have been a problem on my end, seating it incorrectly or something. I'll soon swap to a P-86 strainer.Also, watch out for fingerprints on this! The chrome looks awesome when it's clean, however fingerprints really stand out.. and drive me mad. Minor detail but thought it was worth mentioning.Overall, very good drum. If mine got stolen or destroyed in a fire I would buy another.
__label__2 One glaring omission, one glaringly bad inclusion: What were they thinking when they put this collection together? Yes, it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis's greatest hits but where is "One Night"? And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of "Polk Salad Annie" and omit a classic like "One Night"? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording "Polk Salad Annie." There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White.
__label__2 A book for the ages: I mistakenly checked this book out of the library when I was in 4th grade (1964), thinking it was going to be about knights ("The Silver Sword"). Imagine my surprise when, upon reading the first page, I discovered it was about a young boy (my age) separated from his family during WWII. Yet, even that first page sucked me in. I was not an avid, or even a good reader at that age, but I couldn't put it down, and finished the book in two days. I proceeded to check it out at least once a year until I could no longer find it in libraries. It was probably the single biggest reason I learned to love reading. My son is now in 4th grade, and I logged on to see if I could find it, and will make sure it becomes a part of his life as well.
__label__1 No Joy Here: The site of an immaculately turned out Susan Hampshire in thick eyeliner and gleaming white (flared) trouser suit prancing through the Serengeti should serve as an immediate red flag. This is about as far as you can get from Bill Travers' and Virginia McKenna's charming performances in Born Free, never mind invoking the real Adamsons, who led interesting and ultimately tragic lives. Doesn't seem much like Kenya in the fifties to me (I was there). Give it a miss.
__label__1 Disappointing!: This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship, when the opposite is well-known) and credibility (how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did?). It's also boring.
__label__2 Mini Shuttle Astronaut: I love this item! It occupies the top shelf of my "sci-fi shrine" next to my tiny Star Trek models.
__label__2 Born Free!: This film is great for family! I watched online through Amazon Prime and it played perfect and was so crystal clear! I recommend this movie for all families!This movie will make you laugh and cry it is that Great! I will order this DVD through Amazon.com soon and add it to my library! This movie is also educational for everyone!I Just Love all Cats, wild or tame! I have my own domestic cat called Snowy, he is 8 years old now and mostly all white with a little apricot on his ears and tail, he also has light blue eyes! Cats Rule, Dogs Drool!! Sorry I am just kidding, I like all animals!
__label__2 BORN FREE: THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, THE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE,BUT ITS GREAT TO WATCH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
__label__2 THE FAMILY UNDER THE BRIDGE: THIS BOOK HAD GREAT CHARACTERS AND PLOT. IT TOOK PLACE IN PARIS,FRANCE. IT IS ABOUT A FAMILY WITHOUT A HOME. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS ARMAND, THE TRAMP.THE ILLUSTRATIONS REALLY ADDED TO THE STORY. I CAN SEE WHY IT WON A NEWBERRY MEDAL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE.
__label__1 Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids: This book, set in Paris in late December follows a hobo named Armand, who's gruff on the outside, but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under "his" bridge. While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story. In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there.
__label__2 The Family Under the Bridge: This book, The Family Under the Bridge, is about an old hobo named Armand. He and a family live in Paris.Armand the old hobo pushed all of his belongings around in an old baby buggy, that had no hood.One day Armand took the Calcet children, Suzy, Paul, & Evelyne to see Father Christmas.A whilr later, Armand took the children and their mother to a gypsy camp where they lived for a few days. But then the gypsys moved away and they were again homeless.And because Armand loved the children so much he got a job at the Halles. And while he was there he could picture the wholr family sitting and playing in the house.And until then they have lived happily ever after.
__label__2 Mitford Years ammended: Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.
__label__1 Disappointed: I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books, but it seems like someone forced her to write this one. Very disappointing. Very disjointed.
__label__2 Perfect: Thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition. The book was great and I really love the whole series.
__label__2 Absolutely the BEST: I have worn NARS Sunset Strip lip gloss for over 8 years and still continue to get compliments on the color. I have tried all the other major brands, Dior, La Prairie, Laura Mercier and Bobby Brown to name a few and nothing begins to compare. The color saturation is perfect and the formula is great without being too sticky. Many brands do not stay put, but the NARS is always there. I think the one major difference is that I always use a lip pencil first,, this helps to intensify the color and hold the gloss on the lip. Unfortunately I have been informed that they are discontinuing this color, but they have a new one called wonder that looks similar. Anyway, regardless of the color, I highly recommend NARS lipgloss.
__label__2 Better than expected: My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far, it's been about 3 months, and I do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion. I can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that I previously could not. It's not an overnight cure, but I would recommend this for anyone with a Stage 1 bunion issue. It looks cheap, but it's surprisingly durable! It may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights, but you get used to it.
__label__1 The shadows between: The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but "The Shadows Between" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry.
__label__2 Wonderful book!: I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.
__label__2 Streisand at her comic best: This was Barbra Streisand's first non singing role, but her performance is pure musical-comedy. She is hilariously funny! She also has a very good chemistry with co-star, George Segal. With a truly witty script by Buck Henry, they make a great pair. This is a very funny movie, and makes a great showcase for Ms. Streisand's comedic flair. Her fans will love it, and those who aren't fans? Hey, she'll win you over. Have a great time watching!
__label__1 Warning - misleading listing: This item is advertised as being the R-rated (original) version. It is not! It is the reissued (and censored) GP-13 version which is not nearly as good or as funny.The listing should be corrected and we can only hope that one day the studio will release the DVD in its original version.
__label__2 Anamorphic Widescreen: This imported DVD has a nice picture. It comes in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. The audio is in Dolby Digital Mono and has Korean, Spanish, English and Italian subtittles. Buy it while you can because this movie is not available in DVD in the United States.
__label__1 Okay!: I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
__label__1 misrepresented usefulness: Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles, ie. newspaper, mag. etc.
__label__2 The Slipper and the Rose: Finally,it's going to happen on April 25,2000. I just couldn't believe that a video of one of the best musicals ever made didn't exist. My daughter and I recorded it years ago when she was little and we have watched it over and over for years. You have to get this movie just for the songs which were nominated for the Academy Awards. This movie is destined to become an all time classic. Now, many more people will get to experience the best Cinderella story of all. It's been long overdue.
__label__1 Caution with this supplier: this product is ok however, unlike the discription claims it is not easy to cut, even with new sharp tools, the seets that I recieved tend to be very hard almost like Lenoleum tile for your floor, but even harder serface then even those. Either the product some where got exposed to extreame heat or its old.
__label__1 All show, no go.: The key word in the title is "unique." I'll give it that. I'm sure the contents pass muster as "art," and in that regard, I know what I like; this ain't it. Most of these tracks take forever to go anywhere and sound like Chip Davis & Co. have just discovered synthesizers and looping software. The only really listenable track is "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah", which establishes fairly quickly and at least sounds like the song it's supposed to be. Even it, along with most of the others, is a study in "Hey, Mom, watch this!" sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller. "When You Wish Upon A Star" tangled up with "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" - with neither really coming to the fore - borders on insulting; Jiminy Cricket would not be happy! Unless you're a fan of early Moog experiments, pass on this one.
__label__2 Correction of author: author is Arloc Sherman: As can be found on eric.ed.gov and cbpp.org, and in this review at the Harvard Educational Review ([...]), the correct author of this book is Arloc Sherman.Marian Wright Edelman, a highly noted scholar and activist for children, wrote the Introduction, while Robert M. Solow wrote the Foreword.
__label__2 A kitchen staple: I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage, and, after 20 years, I finally had to replace it. (A second one we received a few years later is still holding up beautifully.) The pan is the perfect size for a can of soup or vegetables or a gravy mix. I absolutely love it!
__label__2 great movie: I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in "Walking tall" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun.
__label__2 I believe he is right: Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.
__label__2 remarkable!!!: I love this cd. My favorite song is "Gills and Tails." I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory. True talent. She is soooooooooooo under rated. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL!!!!
__label__1 A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.: As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy, at least a dozen time, even wrote down every noun in all 5 for a database,) I read both Last Chance to See and DGHDA and loved them. Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. Odin and Thor bored me senseless. I can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel.
__label__2 Gods walk among us: This is the 2nd Dirk Gently novel and like the first it is good fun , with Adams trademark sense of humour. An explosion at Heathrow is called by the press an Act of God, and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole, as Dirk Gently soon discovers.The feel of the novel is reminiscient of Thorne Smith's 'The Night Life of the Gods'. But although Adam's style is always enjoyable, the novel seems a little thin; all wit and little substance. Given Adams notorious bouts with writer's block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished.
__label__1 Boring: I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I did'nt buy it) and was really disapointed. The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal. Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time, some teenagers decide to party in a spooky old school where they just graduated from. There is alot of running around, people crawling through air vents, and of course stabbings. It isn't even gory if you're into that sorta thing and the beginning, which is like a rip-off of Scream is just plain silly....Skip this one or rent it if you have insomnia...
__label__1 you have got to be kidding me: I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
__label__1 Sucked: I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money. It simply sucked.
__label__1 Poor quality product: After 2nd or 3rd usage, inside of the pots started to tarnished (not a food stain). Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter (metallic taste). Very poor quality product.
__label__2 Amazing bargain for the quality: I love this cookware! I had to leave my old kitchen things behind when I moved suddenly last fall due to illness and had gotten some cheap crud at Wal-Mart. BIG MISTAKE. After just 5 months it was a mess, so I went looking at Amazon, Target, and a bunch of other sites. This set was the best bargain and the highest quality I could afford and I could not be much happier with it. The bottoms are heavy and not only retain heat but distribute it evenly. I've only scorched one dish since getting the set and that was my fault, not the cookware. I will be adding other pieces from this line to my collection. Recommended.
__label__2 Great!: I really love this pot. It's a bit larger than I expected, but that's my fault for not researching the size of pots properly. I'm just cooking for myself so 6 quarts is a bit more than needed. Regardless, even when I cook small amounts of things, the food doesn't burn or stick horrifically - this pot conducts heat well and is nice and heavy bottomed. It's easy to clean and I would recommend this pot.
__label__2 For the price, can't beat ths cookware: I bought my first set 30+ years ago and finally walked away from my big kettle and burned it dry (sucks getting old). The product has not changed in that time because its great!
__label__2 Perfection!: I love these guys! Finally, a comedy based on my generation and humor. These guys aren't afraid to put it out there or say whatever is on their minds. If you like silly, stupid, raunchy; then this show is for you.
__label__1 Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions: It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest, but works as a great scare tactic.Please, look at some of the sources used in the research. To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement (Air America, etc?). But, books that are preaching to the choir are a dime-a-dozen these days. The author has his select audience and he's trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions. There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water.
__label__2 Excellent!: This book is very well written and researched. It is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about.
__label__2 Wow.: Even if you know a lot of this stuff, it's bracing (to say the least) to see it all presented at once. It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that "all the wheels come off at once".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of "mainstream" and "outsider" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the "southernization" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable.
__label__1 Super-awful: It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her.
__label__1 poor quality: I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. The chrome plating is also of poor quality. For $100, you would think this would be top quality. Don't waste your money on this item.
__label__2 I've got the ice in me.: Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally, Danny Sasaki and Mike Kunka you might wonder how a double bass - one drummer band works. The answer is heavy and quite well. This EP contains my favorite song by Enemymine: I've Got the Ice in Me. However, the EP is quite heavy and the sounds that Kunka and Sally create with their basses is incredible. Sadly, like godheadSilo, Enemymine was not all that well known. If you are interested in Dead Low Tide or Smoke and Smoke give Enemymine (and godheadSilo) a try.
__label__1 How not to write a book!: This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel, full of exaggeration, distortion,and in many places complete lies.May God have had mercy when Loraine tried explaining his part in his false witness crusade against the the Church, our 2000 year old Catholic Church!
__label__1 Eye opening: It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it, and, seeing not only the inaccuracies and misrepresentations in this book, but also seeing the historical, theological and BIBLICAL cohesion of the claims of the Catholic Church, I became Catholic.Need I say more?
__label__1 Rule#1: Just because it's published doesn't mean it's true.: This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to "describe" Catholicism. It is of note only for its ludicrous claims, half-truths, and outright lies. DON'T BE FOOLED: THIS TEXT IS NOTHING MORE THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL, PITIFULLY IGNORANT ANTI-CATHOLICISM AT ITS WORST.It has value only as an example of atrocious scholarship, flagrant misrepresentation, and outright bigotry.
__label__1 A codex of garbage: This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church. The truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the Bible in order to support Boettner's rancid work.The book is useful for Catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against Catholicism.As a source of honest information, it's a sad joke. A sad joke that still infects some of the more naive minds out there.
__label__1 Outrageous pack of lies: As a former protestant turned Catholic, I have done substantial research myself into the doctrinal basis of Catholic Church teaching. And my conclusion: this book is at best an example of poor scholarship.......but is probably more likely a deliberate attempt to spread anti-Catholic propaganda to unknowing protestants. If you want the TRUTH about Catholic Church doctrine, better to read Karl Keating's "Catholicism and Fundamentalism" or Alan Schreck's "Catholic and Christian". If you are gonna disagree with Catholic Church doctrine, at least know what the actual doctrine IS!!!
__label__1 No understanding of the Catholic Church: The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
__label__1 May God have mercy on you, seriously!: Wow, what can I say? Totally ignorant, very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people. Even those people who don't have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched.I totally get it if one's own or other christian denomination's interpretation of the Bible is different from Roman Catholism and her teachings but when people (especially this book) intentionally MISREPRESENTS, fabricate lies that the other Church TRULY teaches, it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the 9th Commandment of God, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor".Please for humanity's sake.....read a lot of good historical books specially the other's side OFFICIAL teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest, nun or unverifiable source and lastly....be honest!
__label__1 A Good Fantasy: Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts. Catholics should read this just to see how far anti-catholics will go!
__label__1 Good idea that fails in implementation: I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time, place, or culture that surrounded the Dot-Com Boom and why it went bust.

__label__2 A wonderful story: Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life, and painting a word-picture that makes you feel like you're there. He has an easy-going writing style, so it's fun to ride along as he tells his tales. There are times when you'll laugh out loud, and others when you'll find good, solid information about hunting, guns or dogs.
__label__1 Not good enough: I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but then I just lost interest. There were the occasional laugh out loud sections, but it seemed like they weren't coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others. So I say it just wasn't good enough.
__label__1 Made me feel icky: I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of "the rest".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be "icky". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material.
__label__2 A good buy for Sedaris fans, but mostly available elsewhere: I love David Sedaris. I think his writing is very funny, very touching and very entertaining. I go to see Sedaris speak when he's on tour and I read short pieces he's written for The New Yorker and Esquire online. In fact, I've already read many of the stories in this book (which was somewhat disappointing). "Rooster at the Hitching Post" and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you don't want to buy this book. I will say, though, there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it. Just don't be too surprised if you come across something you've read before.
__label__2 Something more serious: If you enjoyed "Me Talk Pretty One Day" then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books, read by the author, which made the stories feel even more personal.
__label__2 Rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter: Being the first David Sedaris book I've ever picked up, I didn't quite know what to think when I first checked it out from the library. But after hearing it raved about by my friends and being highly allured by the cover, I decided to give it a try. Reading this book turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in a very long time. I found myself cracking up at stories like "Six to Eight Black Men", "Baby Einstein" and "Monie Changes Everything." I often laughed so hard I received very curious stares from those around me.David Sedaris is not only hilarious and entertaining, but also a very talented writer who knows how to weave a story unlike any others. I highly, highly, as highly as anyone can, recommend this book for someone, anyone who needs a good laugh.
__label__1 A literary reality show?: Sedaris' book is entirely too self-aggrandizing to rate as entertainment. Spare yourself from the temptation to buy.Lamar Nesbit
__label__1 Random rantings from a drugged homosexual: The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother.
__label__2 Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim: Hearfelt essays on David Sedaris' life growing up gay in middle America. Always full of astute observations of American life, you will laugh out loud many times while reading this collection of essays.
__label__1 good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty: good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty. this complaint is not pan specific. If you have read the tons of consumer complaints against Meyer corp you will see that they do NOT honor there lifetime warranty on the non stick surface. I had my pan for 2 years and the surface stopped working. we have never used the pan in the oven, nor put it in the dish washer and we don't even own anything but plastic pan utensils. all of which makes our pan a perfect candidate to be replaced. according to the website, you don't need an RMA or anything just UPS the pan. well i did. the UPS tracking shows them getting it some 4 months ago and no word from them. after checking around on line, this is typical of them. save your $10 in UPS shipping and buy a different brand. vote with your dollar and spend it else ware.
__label__2 Farberware classic 10 inch frying pan: I've used Farberware for 40 years and have always loved their products. Most of my pots still look great after so much use. They cook food beautifully. The only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use. They can usually be tightened with a screwdriver, but after a long while, it's a bit more difficult.
__label__2 Fantastic: I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!!Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses 2 pound) by igourmet.com
__label__1 It didn't help my vision: I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit.
__label__2 Terrific Album but what happened to 4 Strong Winds?: I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.
__label__1 Great music, terrible recording/sound quality: The recording is so bass heavy that it is not pleasurable to listen to. The music on this CD is also on the live "Heart of Gold" DVD movie...the sound quality is quite good on the live recording. Mr. Young's performance of the songs is also better on the live recording.
__label__1 Prairie Wind review: The CD does not play. I have tried it in several different CD players and it simply doesn't play. The Johnny Cash CD I purchased with it plays just fine, so I don't know why it doesn't work. I would appreciate a replacement.
__label__1 Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted: I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2,695 times on the radio a day.Why? Plus I've heard the songs are too slow. This is too muchof an overrated CD! Buy the last album from Neil Young, GreatestHits it has better songs like his best, Down by the River, andthe great grunge, Hey Hey, My My. This is a waste of money.
__label__1 Lost in stereotypes: A decent book that could have been great, Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in, incomplete, cookie-cutter characters, and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of "L.A. Story" sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events, this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel, and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it.
__label__1 If you like reading for the sake of reading...: Ultimately, this book is frustrating. It drones on like our own mundane lives, except the characters in the book are unbelievable. Everyone is an exaggeration. Too rich, too full of themselves, too over the top, too self serving.The conversations are all meaningless, except maybe the one where Richard's son tells him how he feels about their relationship.Even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended.If you like reading for the sake of reading, I recommend it. If you're looking for inspiration to change your life, do what the hero did... walk out your door and open your eyes...
__label__1 Misguided Purchase: The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
__label__1 Not as shown: This product is shown in its picture setup with a top. There is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with. What you get is a white folded cloth in a bag.
__label__1 No plot: The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
__label__1 B movie: The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting, using greek myth to drive the theme. B movie when you're bored.
__label__1 Ewwwww...: What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
__label__2 Excellent (no spoilers): Only this and 'Sherlock Holmes' were grabbing my interest on the new Video On Demand releases. I was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick. I'm so glad I picked 'Triangle'. I haven't been this freaked out by a movie in a long time. There's truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end. Superb directing, the atmosphere was just fantastic. Melissa George really showed her acting potential here, although I only have one other movie to compare to. And I'm like, who are these other actors? Surely one of them is going to completely bring the movie down in some way. Absolutely not. Solid acting all around. If you dig 'Twilight Zone' or just like freaky movies that make you think afterwards, you can't go wrong with this gem.
__label__2 stealth movie: a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
__label__1 Don't waste your time: The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie, I wonder if the positive reviewers were paid to review this movie. It is very frusterating to watch because the main character continues to make the same mistakes over and over again. The ending brings no closure. Spoiler: The beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning. I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot.
__label__1 Poorly researched, this book is a must-NOT Read.: No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary.
__label__1 very poor quality: I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort. While I think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events, i can't understand why her language is so dismal.
__label__2 trashy, but quick and entertaining: I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!
__label__2 Couldn't put it down!: I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school, I probably would have considered majoring in history in college! Gregory's writing is absolutely delicious. She enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted. Now I am completely fascinated by historical novels. Another recommendation from my book club is Abundance, about Marie Antoinette. (Even if you don't read it, please know that Marie is NOT the one who said "Let them eat cake!" That infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her. She actually loved the French people.) Anyway, this novel is much better than the movie "The Other Boleyn Girl," which I did see, so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story!
__label__2 The Other Boleyn Girl: This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down, the story keeps you wondering what will happen next, even when you know the historical ending.A very enjoyable book to read!
__label__1 Tawdry: For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy.
__label__2 Scandle, sex, and fun: I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.
__label__1 Not worth the time: First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her "cotton head". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim.
__label__2 Makes you want to keep reading on: A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look.
__label__2 Easy reading: Book is very different than the movie, it's more indept. I enjoyed it, would recommend to fans of the Tudor age.
__label__2 LOVED THIS BOOK: I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on, and I never bore of it. And to think I owe it all to this book! It's from Mary Boleyn's point of view. You will see her challanges as well as Anne and the rest of their family. You will feel like your right there at court with them. It's an exciting and fearful time at the court of Henry VIII. It is also very accurate and I highly recommend it. Its one of Phillippa Greggory's better books. I've read all her books and this one is by far her best work. You will fall in love with the Tudor era if your not already.
__label__2 History Brought to Life: This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family.
__label__1 I Already Knew the story: I have to admit, I usually do not like historical fiction...this book was no exception. I read half, and read the end because it was boring.....
__label__1 Historical Fiction Overdone!: With an emphasis on the "fiction" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well, historical!
__label__1 Finally finished it: I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative. And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness. This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on. Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author.
__label__1 A novel for the intellectually challenged: Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will, after reading--or trying to read--THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a "dime novel"-that pejorative characterizing hack writing, which in our time is seen most often in historical romances-novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is such a novel. In our time of computers, the internet and blogs, the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques. It's a world where lies flourish, and publications such as "Publishers Weekly" with their fatuous critiques, become co-conspirators in this deception.
__label__1 "Other Boleyn Girl" a future Lifetime movie for certain: The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in "The Other Boleyn Girl." That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine "heroine" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book...
__label__2 One of the best books I have ever read!: This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family, since she is barely 13 when first presented to the king. She succeeds in keeping him at her side for a while, until his eyes begin to wander again and he seeks fulfilment (in every way) elsewhere. All of a sudden she is commanded to stand back and let her sister Anne bathe in the king's glory. In my opionion Mary was quite helpless, whereas her sister Anne is portrayed as a scheming whore. The author has a fabulous way with words and if you are interested in English history written at a wonderful pace as well as a thrilling account(in other words: you will probably be utterly, competely, totally unable to put this book down, once you have started) this is a book you simply cannot miss!
__label__2 Very enjoyable...: Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era, history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character.
__label__2 A "can't put down" book!: It's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's beautifully written. Gregory finds a great balance of description, not to much not to little. She has this great ability to make the reader feel as he were in that space and time. I also found that the author leaves you with the feeling of "wanting to find out more" which I find great. I finished this book last night (2am, couldn't stop reading)and first thing in the morning I was at the bookstore looking for more books on the topic. I'm going to start "The secret diary of Anne Boleyn" , I hope it's as good as this one. Don't miss this great read!!!
__label__2 A Fast Read: I breezed through this book and I found it a great read. I had a hard time with some of the stuff, like being married at twelve and the beheading, however, I enjoyed the view point from so long ago and how very difficult women had it. I have leant this book out and haven't gotten it back!
__label__2 When Movies were More Fun: I had recorded this movie originally off of TV years ago. It is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories. What I really appreciated with this DVD is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
__label__2 13 Ghosts Review: I saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake. Then I found out that Martin Milner was in it and I knew I had to see it. This was your typical old black and white movie. With the typical dialogue that you would think. But I thought this movie was really funny, i know it's not supposed to be but oh well. Different times during the movie the background would change to blue and then ghosts would appear in red. The problem that I didnt realize when I bought this movie was that you need those 3-D glasses to view the ghosts without straining your eyes. I really liked this movie. It wasnt as scary as the recent one but it was a good horror movie for the 60's.
__label__1 Disappointed....: I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
__label__1 good idea, poor implementation: Poor quality product. Great idea - my daughter was super-excited to get this one, but flash light broke right away, binoculars are not strong at all, thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp-re properly. Very disappointing purchase.
__label__2 A very pretty decoration for all, and fun for children: The lovely watercolor print shows a pond skating scene, full of Holly Pond Hill bunnies in their victorian costumes. Very sweet! There is a little flap to open for each day of the advent season with a cute little surprise inside.It will stand upright on a table or under your tree. It can be stored for use in years to come.I'm looking forward to starting an advent calendar tradition with my toddler this year. She'll really enjoy those cute bunnies.
__label__2 Flawless: Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge.Construction quality is very precise... much better than I would have expected for a product of this nature. This product will save HUGE dollars over feeding HP their profit gouging prices for OEM. Hooray!
__label__2 Clear and concise, but requires supplementation: Griffiths' QM text provides excellent problems and a coherent, though somewhat cryptic, development of the theory. He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work.
__label__2 Not just for breast feeding moms :-): Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms, though I can definately see how it would be a great asset for those who choose to breastfeed.I've used it during feedings, to take some strain off my arm (because baby can get heavy to hold in an upright position that is best for bottle feeding.) I've also used it to prop my baby up in a sitting position and she loves it! She looks so comfortable, I almost wish they made adult size boppys :-) I have also put it around my waist (and yes, it does bring back prego memories!) and layed the baby in it so she can snuggle close to me while my hands are free to do other things (read, change the channel, etc.) A great buy for every parent!
__label__2 PHOTOGRAPHERS HELPER: I don't have children yet, but my profession is a photographer, and with infants so little it's sometimes hard to get them in a perfect pose, the boppy is a great tool to get a natural look, you can cover it with a blanket to match whatever you want, so next time you go to get those special memories captured, bring along your boppy and introduce your favorite photographer to the boppy, ( i also prop it up a little if they are on a table, and the camera is fixed ie jcpenney or sears) Congrats to all and many smiles!!!
__label__2 AWESOME PRODUCT: I LOVE THIS! I AM A FIRST TIME MOM WHO BREAST FEEDS MY BABY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE SUCH A LIFE SAVER! MY SON IS 9 MONTHS NOW AND WE STILL USE IT ALMOST EVERY FEEDING. IT SAVES YOUR ARM AND NECK FROM FEELING STRAINED AND HOLDS THE BABY AT JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR NURSING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY MOTHER.
__label__1 Don't really get it...not useful for us at all!: I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up, but most of the time, she was supported by my legs or multiple pillows. I think this is one of those products that's either love/hate--for us, it has to be the latter!
__label__1 recalled boppy: I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first.
__label__1 Wait to buy: I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews, bought the pillow and never used it. I had an 8 lbs. 9 oz. baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it. It got in the way. Now it just sits in a corner. I guess I'll use it when he's learning to sit up to prop him up with. I urge mothers to borrow one first to see if they like it before spending the $.
__label__2 A great product!: We got this to support our arms while bottle feeding (though it seems to be known for breastfeeding-it is helpful to us bottle feeders as well.) The unique shape is great because it can be turned to be comfortable for different sized people and different height chairs. Also, our 2 week old loves to lie in it. It keeps him snuggled and supported and it gives our arms a break now and then! :) The pillow is so soft that sometimes when I snuggle with him in it that both of us take a little nap! It is a bit pricy (that's why it's 4 stars and not 5), but it makes a great gift!
__label__2 Great for taking pretty photos: This Boppy was very helpful in feeding my daughter during the early weeks of life. It also helped with laying her down when she was in the phase of waking up everytime you put her down. I would nurse her and then transfer her to the bed on the pillow, then remove the pillow. But most of all, I loved taking photos of my daughter with the clouds as the backround. It makes some of the most beautiful pictures when they are small and can't do much.
__label__2 Roses are reds, violets are blue, this movie is recommended for you!: A warm and rather lighthearted movie that is pleasing to most tastes and obviously uplifting to the vast majority of reviewers here at Amazon. Not a whole lot of character development throughout the movie, but the characters are rather endearing nonetheless. Some will be skeptical as to the plausibility of such a prison set up, but it was refreshing to see an approach to incarceration that offers some real rehabilitation and redemption.
__label__2 This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine.
__label__1 Definitely a disappointment!: I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
__label__1 SORDID BOOK!: While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature, he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed, they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive. To expect boys to shrug off social conditioning in such a short time is, however absurd.
__label__1 how can you like this?: this book had good morals but it was so confusing, that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes. some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i cant remember one cliffhanger chapter ending. trust me, if you are a teen, take it from another, unless FORCED to read this for school (like i was) dont read this book. it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book. whoever called it a classic is crazy
__label__2 Golding at his Greatest: Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic. One can relate to the actions of the characters simply because we were all once of that age and were all once driven by the same urges, impulses, and emotions that Golding so graphically and yet so effectively illustrates. An essential read there can be no doubt......
__label__2 Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the "The Lord of the Flies" was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But " The Lord of the Flies" was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read.
__label__2 all in all a good book: Well written but definately not my "cup of tea". High reccomendations for those who enjoy this type of literature.
__label__2 A must read: The noval "Lord of the flies" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way.
__label__1 Weird: I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls, wasnt they susposed to repopulate the world after nuclear war so not possible wih only boys. The one thing i found interesting was how they acted like wild animals after they had been on the island a while.that was kinda cool.But it was to confusing
__label__1 Not the Best novel: Well I have read this in 7th grade. I really don't think of it as a great novel. I have read better. It depends on what your taste in novels are I suppose. I know that this isn't a good review on this novel and I am sorry if this misleads you. Well, I suggest to read it before you decide whether or not you like it.
__label__2 You sure you want to read this?: This book is not for a rainy day. Rainy day's are depressing and exploring the dark side of the human soul is no less. If you are into dreams leave this book on the shelf. If you want to feel like puking from the pit of stomach at the depts of human depravity this is the book for you.One sentence to describe this book:A daring expose of the cruelty of children and a slap on the wrist of anybody who thinks kids don't need discipline.
__label__1 Most Disappointed: Well, how can I review this product when it still haven't arrived. It has apparently been resent but once again hasn't arrived. Very disappointed!!!!
__label__1 An unbelievable waste of time.: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.
__label__1 Thumbs down: God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original.
__label__1 It's a good book, but not my favorite: Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is "good". I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent.
__label__2 The Lord of the Flies is a great book.: The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school, because is shows a great struggle for survival on a deserted island with basicly nothing.
__label__1 Great book, but the author's reading is terrible: I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation.
__label__1 It is worse than reading the dictionary: It was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i
__label__1 Yow! Lots of people wrote stuff, huh?: This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.
__label__1 Disgusted: I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children.
__label__2 Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!
__label__1 Boring: I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part, but it was still bad. l did not get into this book or enjoy it. it was for school.
__label__1 I don't like the book: I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
__label__2 A brilliant achievement. Symbolism beyond comparison.: This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to "read books for school," but this one is not one of the "boring" kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it.
__label__2 great classic book: this book came on time and was in good condition. It has been on my list of books to read for a very long time
__label__2 A fairly simple story with deep meaning: LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to "drag on".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read.
__label__1 No wonder they call it the Lord of the Flies this book stunk: My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader
__label__1 a conventional view of mankind: this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result.
__label__1 Took too long: It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book.
__label__1 May be a classic...but not as good as people think: I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something "deeper" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you.
__label__1 Lord of the Flies was creative, but lost our attention.: We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil.
__label__2 A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.
__label__2 Shocking: I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)
__label__1 Novel review of the Lord of the Flies: The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names.
__label__2 Nice Book: I think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read . The message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times, morden times and the future you must read this book.
__label__2 Adventouros story, good plot and fantastic characters!: This is a book for every teen to read. It gives the feelng of pride... and intense excitment!
__label__2 Thought-provoking, creepy, depressing, and intuitive: I read this book two years ago for a grade 10 English class, and have not had the chance to reread it, but I do remember it well. The premise is not especially exciting initially, but it becomes a living parable of terror.I find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls, or both. But would this have changed the outcome? That is something you must decide for yourself. Also, when finally "saved", the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly, and yet Ralph knows exactly. Perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be.Though chilling, I highly recommend this book, as it gives a startling clear view of broken society. It's pessimistic, but perhaps, all too realistic.
__label__2 Everyone Should Read this Novel: This is one of those novels that everyone should read. Through isolation on a remotes island, we get to glimpse the life of these young boys and how chaos takes over their uncivilized new world. The refelection on human nature may be frightening but it is riveting and honest.Lord of the Flies is a short and easy read, and it should not be missed. I highly recommend this novel!
__label__2 the what ol' days?: I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences.
__label__1 A girlie book with lots of blood: Friends who know I`m interested in war history recommended this book. But this is not war history. This is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details. If you are looking for the real stuff, go somewhere else.
__label__1 Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful: This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking, it's completely out of date.My major criticism, though, is the low value of the content. Do we really need to be taught that soft or pastel colors appeal more to women? Not only is that kind of thinking outdated, but who needs to read a book with that level of "information"?
__label__1 They cut the extras: I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of "Otis" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, "Dr. Giggles" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome.
__label__1 Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan, and I love to read the continuations and sequels. However, I had trouble finishing this book. The break in the writing between Austen's original text and the addition is glaring. The style changes, the characters change, the plot leaps wildly. It's almost like two books -- the author shouldn't have bothered keeping the original text. She probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style. I highly recommend reading the other Sanditon continuation by Anne Telscombe instead. It does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character.
__label__1 very dull and witless: This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
__label__1 Not for kids under 12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun "learning experience" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics.
__label__2 Compact Phono: Portable And Plays 78 RPMs: This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
__label__2 A great, varied album.: Techno, house, ambient, dance, electronica, whatever you want to call it, "Everything is Wrong" is just great music by a great artist. It has everything a fan of pop music could want.
__label__2 THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
__label__1 Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of "creating business". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy. We are, however, very dedicated to children and their needs....whether that involves "Einstein type children", Asperger's, Autistic, Hyperlexic, Attention Deficit Disordered, Gifted or any of the multitude of diagnoses.
__label__2 Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late: If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child.
__label__2 How to go to College Almost for Free: I bought this for my grandson, he has already written in for several grants, and working on more. This is a great gift for any high school kid, and even kids in college. I don't believe the parents should go into debet for this, the kids will do much better if they have to work for it. I've seen to many parents almost go broke with several kids at college at the same time. They end up with nothing for retirement. Believe me, you need a nest egg.Take if from a grandma that has a great pension.
__label__2 Cool Book: I'm not much for writing book reviews, but this book was so good that I decided to do so anyway. The author has really done a comprehensive treatment of the subject of college scholarships. This is the scholarship book to get.
__label__2 How To Go To College For Almost Free: This book is very informative. Ben Kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner. This is a great book for parents and students alike.
__label__1 The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance. Please, play with the kids, walk around the block, start drinking, but don't waste your time on this book.
__label__2 THE great American literary genius of the 20th Century.: Let's see now ... have you bought in to the "PowerPoint," bullet-ed, "concise" notion of literature (i.e., stupid, undeveloped, soul-less notion of expressing what it is to be human?) --In THAT case, you will find the works of Thomas Wolfe (as you find the works of Marcel Proust or Thomas Mann) a great big bore. Otherwise ... you will NOT find them a bore; but the very opposite of a bore:--a source of inspiration, of joy, of excitement, of the quintessence of life.
__label__2 Orson Welles and Magic: I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies, I appreciate the genius of his work. I picked up a copy of this book recently and am amazed at the amount of research put into it. An aspect of Welles rarely discussed is his magic career. At the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention this September in Aberdeen, Maryland, I plan to attend the presentation about Orson Welles and his magic career so I can watch rare footage and films with Welles, and get an even deeper insight to his trickery. Book comes recommended.
__label__2 Used It For Years: We've used this product for many years. It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly. They shine better than they did when new.
__label__1 Poor Service from Home and Beyond: I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week, now it is this week. I have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product.
__label__1 Vapid and vacuous: The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
__label__1 Dumber & Dumber: Yeah, same wisecracking dialogue, sidekicks, and relationship quandaries as the Spenser novels.Realized the plot was familiar a few chapters in-- lifted from previous early Spencer novel.Characterizations inconsistent and contrived if not absurd-- a lot of villainous stereotypes-- and the plot point that the whole story is based on is ludicrous.There are much better written "guilty pleasures" than this one-- some by the same author.
__label__2 Parker's new charge...: Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex, deceit and extortion. Not his best but getting his feet wet with this new female perspective, he makes more than a solid effort. (he gets the ball rolling in following tales) I'm grateful to Mr. Parker and his pen (figuratively???) If you are a fan...don't miss it. If you're not...WHY not???!!!!
__label__2 Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing, buy this CD only for this track. A 10-minute long epic ambient composition. Showcases the genius that Moby is. There are several other very good songs on this album. This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between. Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music, but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock. Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice, but rest assured, they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music. Again, Moby shows that he doesn't go by what sells. Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby's works are highly underrated and misunderstood. This is one of them. Moby's music is intelligent music. Unfortunately, not many people can understand or appreciate that.
__label__2 Awesome series.: The autumn series its just amazing,I first bought them in ebooks but it was so good thAt I had to buy the complete series in paperback.It's amazing how after so many books the author keeps you in suspense and doesn't get boring,this Moody guy it's really gifted.
__label__1 GSM Phones: Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery, and take a look at your Nokia phone. The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA, like the 5185. Guess what? It dosen't work.
__label__2 excellent reading: this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible. this man was very knowledgeable about his subject. he was also very familiar with his subject [jesus] as you will see when you read this book. no christian should be without this book in his library.
__label__2 typos galore!: I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the "misspelled" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library.
__label__1 Overrated: This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
__label__1 Very slow: Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed.
__label__2 Fresh and exciting!: When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen, I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do. I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think. The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music. I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself. And that what they do today...will shape the sound of tommorow!
__label__2 Great for the beginner, the experienced, and the wanna-be: This is one of the few dog books I own that I would gladly spend money on again.I especially appreciate their section on selecting a dog specifically for the sport. Since most of us skijor with our pets, they make a point of emphasising what you want to live with 365 days a year. They also have a great section on training for races.My only hope is that they'll have a new edition out someday including training details for distance skijoring, which is bound to be a growing segment of the sport.
__label__2 Great product!: I took a chance ordering this product, because there weren't many reviews. I'm glad I did! I got it a few days ago. Connecting my PC to my TV went fine (basicaly, my TV serves as a second PC monitor now), and after adjusting the screen resolution, the image was perfect. Very little fuzzyness. The quality of the videos I played was very good, and well transfered to the TV. The cables are not super long, something to think about if your PC and TV are far apart. A good choice, and I'll update in a few weeks/months to say how it holds up!
__label__2 A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends,Jack Halder and Rachel Stern are at work for the Nazis. They are setting up a German plan to assasinate Roosevelt and Churchill in Egypt. It is up to Weaver to stop them. They are of course reunited. This excellent book has many surprises as well as manytwists and turns. The book will definitely leave you wondering what if? Be sure to read this book, you will not be dissapointed.
__label__2 Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic. One of the best free books I've gotten for the Kindle!
__label__1 Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen: The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book, not a printed one. Paper quality is the worst. It's totally incompatible with the US$ 140 price.It should be out-of-print or something and then Prentice-Hall found it cheaper to photocopy and bind it, rather then issuing a new edition. Amazon.com should let customers know this in advance.The book content is great as the other reviewers have said, but I'm about to see a book with worse print quality than the one Amazon sent me.I wish I have bought a used book, printed 15 years ago, for US$ 40.
__label__1 Not good: I tried to read it, it was just so boring and bad. His other books are good, this book is not.
__label__1 bad video: James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after "JFK" came out in late 1991---everything good, bad, and ugly came out in book and tv form...this is one of the ugly moments.Vince Palamara
__label__1 Good packaging - no mushrooms :(: While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go, I was not able to get it to produce mushrooms. I followed the instructions keeping it moist and at the cooler temperatures, but nothing ever happened. I also tried oyster mushrooms a few weeks prior to that, and got huge crops of those, so I was disappointed that these didn't grow at all.
__label__2 satisfying middle book of a fantasy/romance trilogy: Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School, where gods of patterns and time take the shape of white stallions and help determine the future of the Empire. But she and her teacher, First Rider Kerrec, both carry damage from their encounters with enemies of the Empire. Those same enemies, barbarians who follow the Unmaking (which would lead to the destruction of the world), threaten the Empire again. Can two damaged Riders, and the stallion gods who carry them, help the Empire win a deadly war?While this is the middle book of a trilogy, I preferred it to both the beginning and concluding books. I tend to be a reader of fantasy rather than romance, and I actually think that the romantic triangles/quadrangles in the other two books detracted from the plots of those books. They really felt sort of forced to me.
__label__1 beware: First of all, this book isn't 344 pages as listed. It is only 156. Secondly, this book only consists of english words and their chinese equivalents in simplified character form. NO pinyin and NO example sentences. This book would only be useful to Chinese people who want to translate english words directly into Chinese. This book is advertised as both english-chinese and chinese-english, however there is no chinese-english. I ordered this book before it was released and just received it. I am extremely disappointed. I repeat: NO Pinyin and NO example sentences.
__label__1 Sometimes less is more!: I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares. I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year. Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out. His performance was less than remarkable. An earlier review mentioned that Dillon was a much better choice of teen angst/rebellion than was Steve McQueen. Interesting, where the hell has Dillon been since this abortion of a film? McQueen is an icon and is still much more popular than Dillon. McQueen is also dead.
__label__2 The Blob- Fear has no shape: This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much, words cannot describe. Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillion, Donovan Leitch, erika eleniak, candy clarke and the always georgeou Ricky Paull Goldin are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are great. I adore the music. Chuck Russell made the best movie. One of the best movies around.
__label__1 A family saga that disappoints: I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick "Stone From the River" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga, I cared nothing about any of the characters in this book. It was tedious, boring and repetitive. The premise of how an act in childhood affects members of several families for years to come seemed intriguing, but it was the only reason that held me to the end and then I realized that the book was actually a waste of time.
__label__2 Excellent even for those without formal musical training: Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training, explains everything starting with the music notation. The exercises are truly gradual: each introduces only a few new hand positions, and future exercises reinforce hand positions introduced earlier. The early exercises are simple yet sound reasonably well not to be hopelessly boring, and one can hear when one plays them incorrectly. Great book for self-study. It was recommended to me independently by two very good classical guitar players; and my technique and sight-reading skills have improved notably since starting to use this book.
__label__2 Another rocking Weeds Season.: Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
__label__2 Great series: A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
__label__1 Kate Mulgrew before Voyager: "A Time for Miracles" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected, and showing Kate Mulgrew as a determined woman who was strong willed, clever, not afraid of anyone, and was fond of coffee. No wonder she was cast as Katherine Janeway.
__label__2 Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape. Overall a great experience.
__label__1 How To Write a Movie in 21 Days: I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However, you might draw some inspiration from it.
__label__2 This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books, but this book will get you off and running & thinking about the task of screenwriting. For what the author intends to do, I give her 5stars.The Inner Movie Method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better. It's concise, upbeat & "can do" in spirit.Accessible. Short Chapters. Exercises. Some good summaries. I like her overview of the stages of life & movie theme that concern each.A pleasure to read. Guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience.But again... this is a place to begin.
__label__2 Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien, but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to O'Malley. Neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of Sarah's spacecraft. While she is saved by O'Malley and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies.(Also aliens) She is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the VLA (very large array)in New Mexico. Both Sarah and O'Malley have led very colorful lives before this encounter--and both want out of that past life. This is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it, cause it was hard for me to put it down.
__label__2 Out of the ashes: The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question, has anyone who has criticized the SGI done anything to help humanistic causes all over the world? The only thing critics have to offer is silence.
__label__2 A Great Summary of Labor Law: I am an ESL teacher with a background in law. A Colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws. This book was an excellent introduction to labor law. Anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book.TCB
__label__1 Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it.
__label__1 Superficial: I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like "Kill your television", "Read yourself a story"... (these are chapters titles from the book). Do not expect a deep philosophical of psychological insight about human motivation or even human nature in general from this book.
__label__2 Good video, Great Gift for new Parents: This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful. A great gift idea.
__label__1 Did not fit BCM carry handle: Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
__label__2 CCS Yellow Cutting Pad: Used with a Porter Cable buffer/vibrator, this yellow cutting pad along with a "cleaner" will take out buff marks and swirls. Finish off with a "white pad" and polish and then when waxed your car will look like it has a showroom finish.
__label__2 WORTH IT!!!!: Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company, so no reflection on them).....my husband loves it. He uses it for cold therapy only: his preference, not that it does not work well for that. So I can only tell you for cold therapy it rocks. I did not think it was cold enough for my lower back, but it is not sculpted for that. He loves its flexibility and states it is cold enough. He uses it for chronic neck pain. Just wraps it on his neck and goes to bed: it has a Velcro strap to keep it in place. Almost like having a neck pillow on, but not as bulky. FABU product!!!
__label__1 Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit: My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or, even worse, drilled in the WRONG PLACE. Some pieces are cut the wrong size and just don't fit!! What a terrible WASTE OF MONEY. There is no way to make it work without major drilling and sanding and then re-painting.My son is so disappointed -- he was really looking forward to putting this together.
__label__2 Entertaining to the last page: Trollope is addictive, but some of his books offer more nonstop entertainment than others, and this is one of those.
__label__1 Printer won't work now...: I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge. Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly. My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge, my printer would not let me use it anymore. I kept getting an error message that said "Please remove and check your black ink cartridge". I tried cleaning it, resetting the printer..tried everything to no avail. I contacted the manufacturer of the refill system and they rapidly sent me a new one, which I haven't tried. Now I need to buy a new ink cartridge for my printer to even operate! Very disappointed.
__label__2 good: I enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal . The cost is very economical. I will buy again.
__label__1 I was not pleased: I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word "COPY" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original.
__label__1 Trite, predictable tear jerker: Given the rave reviews of others, I expected an absorbing, thought provoking read. I found instead a book riddled with cliches, superficial character development and a predictable conclusion. Having just read Ian McEwan's Atonement, the contrast was dramatic. All That Matters would be a good fit for the condensed novel section of a traditional woman's magazine. All That Matters is to fiction what Rod McEuan(Listen to the Warm) is to poetry. Why do I feel that Jan Goldstein is hoping to cash in big with this one?
__label__2 All That Matters: I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
__label__1 Item Not Available: This item was out of stock, so I did not receive it. However, I received timely notification from Amazon.com.
__label__2 Twilight Zone fans will love it: I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection, and I'm glad I read this one. Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing. Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book. I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of "Bone Collector" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work.
__label__2 Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by "Triangle" and "The Christmas Present" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!
__label__1 I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called "top talent" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did.
__label__1 It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie, but they keep bringing it up. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool.
__label__2 Inspiring and Soul-Searching!: Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it, too. I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms.
__label__2 Through the Narrow Gate: Older book with new foreword. Personal discription of life in convent by well-known religious author.
__label__1 too goofy and cheesy....: Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books, I just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of YOUR hard earned money since I already wasted mine on this book.What started out as quirky and light, quickly turned terribly cheesy, goofy,implausible and over the top cliche' with an almost nonexistent storyline about 80 pages in. It reads like teen fiction-and not in a good way. And yet again in the steadily disappointing Luna line-almost zero romance. Take my advice and skip this sad attempt.
__label__1 Eggs stuck immediately: I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it, my egg whites stuck to it. I used a plastic spatula as recommended as well. I'll be getting my money back as it has a 60 day trial period.
__label__2 Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily, cooks wonderfully, and has a great weight to it. I've never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear. This is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others, and I couldn't be more satisfied.
__label__2 A daughter of the Mennonites: Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
__label__1 Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results.
__label__2 (Based on a) True Story: Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
__label__1 a great disappointment: The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
__label__1 Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto "Sci-fi Wasabi" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on.
__label__1 You've got to be kidding!: Why would they release such a complete mess like SciFi Wasabi as a single?...completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest. Musically and lyrically a disaster. I'd rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive.
__label__2 Better Than the First: But not as revolutionary as the first album "Viva La Woman." I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica, sometimes Alternative, sometimes just plain weird. The weird part makes sense because Shaun Lennon has an influence of this band. One track reminded me of John Lennon's Revolution 9 in that both still give me nightmares. Number 9, number 9...
__label__2 Excellent Movies: I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters, and did not watch it again until I bought this double disk set. I enjoyed it just as much if not more than it's incredible sequel. Both movies together, even though they are very loosely related, add up to a great buy.
__label__1 Rust problems: This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
__label__2 A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns "A Spiritual Tourist" is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of "verbati" in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring. I thouroughly enjoyed every minuite and found many of his conclusions enlightening.
__label__1 Raises good questions, but was it edited?: Was this book edited? I think the publisher should be ashamed. If you can slog through the grammatical errors, typos and generally poor writing, you might find this book interesting. However, given that it appears to have been unedited, and given that folks in-the-know have pointed out technical inaccuracies to me, I wouldn't take anything written in this book as the gospel truth. It did raise some interesting questions that I will research.I will think twice before buying a book from this publisher again.
__label__2 ellery queen mysteriesa: This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
__label__2 A very nice shoe: I bought this more for fashion than function, but it has both. It is a very comfortable shoe, and very durable. It is also really nice looking.
__label__2 Great running shoe but why is price way up?: The double-edged sword of rating a product highly: you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price. I bought this exact shoe 1-1/2 yrs ago for $45 w/free Super-Saver shipping. Now the shoe costs $73 + shipping? Maybe we should all keep our mouths shut. And what's w/the different pricing for different sizing? Sounds like discrimination to me. Could be a federal offense.I've given it 5 stars to see how much higher the price rises.
__label__2 A classic: It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
__label__2 So sweet!: Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
__label__1 Forced previews: The movie is fine, but the DVD has previews of other movies that cannot be skipped over. Please don't pay money to support this practice. If you pay for the movie, you shouldn't have to pay again by watching ads.
__label__2 A perfect film: "Babe" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there, and nothing seems to be missing -- the funny touches with the mice, the love between Babe and Farmer Hogget, the themes on family and self-identity -- any adult or child can watch this movie and love it.
__label__1 Not Good At All: This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly, I sat down. I hated it. She fast forwarded it to the middle so we could see the end. Even that part was bad, and I didn't see all of it! I'd give it -10 stars for horrible scenes, cruelty to animals, and lack of trying. DON'T SEE IT EVER!!!
__label__2 No Skip-Ahead function on this DVD: BABE is a wonderful movie, but this DVD does not allow the viewer to skip thru the previews. Once the movie begins you can skip around, but you have to sit thru a bunch of previews EVERY TIME your kid watches this movie.
__label__2 Dundee II: Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
__label__1 Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months: I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
__label__2 Oldie and Goodie: My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
__label__2 Excellent stuff!: This face wash is great, it's light, foaming, and again, in the first 24 hours of using the exuviance products, there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture and overall look. It's amazing! My Proactive is going away, and I'm all over this stuff now.
__label__1 Worse than surgery: The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables.
__label__2 Amazing but not his best: This is Jimi's most famous performance, maybe since its included in the most famous concert ever. Still, there are better concerts of Jimi than this one. It takes him and the band almost all of disc one to warm up. On Red house, Larry Lee plays the lead guitar, so believe me, any other live version of Red House is better than this one. But just as the concert is near its end, Jimi starts playing Star Splanged banner and makes everything worthwile. This is one of rock most memorable moments, one of those that youll have stuck in your mind no matter what, like Elvis playing Ed Sullivan, or the Beatles coming to America. So, from that track till the end of CD2 youll hear nothing but some of the best music ever recorded. Now, if you can get the Monterrey CD on a second hand shop, that is Jimi's best performance ever. Or get Band of gipsys instead.
__label__1 poor: The product did not operate as stated on the box. The supplier CDROMUSA wasn't at all helpful and left me with a product I'm unable to use; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They don't deserve a star at all, but the one star represents the nice, deceptive packaging.
__label__2 movies that make you THINK: How many times in our lives have we wanted a "do over" in our lives thinking if we could just "change" one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives. These movies make you realize, life can never be perfect no matter how many times you could try!
__label__1 Overpriced and too many restrictions on use: This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best, and I thought I would get what I paid for, but it is no different than other pans a half the price. Also, the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop-outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable.
__label__2 My recommended buy: Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware, but it did not include a 2 qt. covered Saucepan.This size is something I use a lot. I love the lighter weight than the 14 yr. old set we had. The rubberized handle and lid are great.I love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great! Clean-up is very easy. I don't use high heat as directed, but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted. I highly recommend this size pan and the whole set. It is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands, but I like the look and function better. I am a very satisfied customer.
__label__1 Not good at all!: This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!
__label__1 A Disappointment: I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich "Spenser for Hire" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!
__label__2 The Power of the Witch: I loved this book. It's very informitive. I like the fact that my friend, who is very far from being pagan, read it and understood it. It does exactly what the man behind the counter told me it would do. TEACH. I even email Laurie and told her how much I loved it.
__label__1 Not Impressed by Cabot: I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft.
__label__1 A guide to one-night stands: This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically, you will probably get laid using these tips, but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you'd want to see again... ever.For example, what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens' behavior? She is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you. Unless she's an idiot. But hey, if you read this book with the goal of getting laid, you're probably into that.
__label__1 Not entirely original...: Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from "The Layguide" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like "layguide" and "player guide" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy "The Art of Seduction" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well.
__label__1 Some reasonable advice.: I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these,also available from this site:1)"U.S.S."(Undercover Sex signals")By Leil Lowndes.2)"How to pick up girls!" By Eric Weber.3)"How to meet the right woman" By Roger Ratcliff,David Conaway & Diana Ohlsson.4)"How to pick up(get dates with)beautiful women:secrets every man should know".By John Eagan,B.A.5)"Understanding women:The definitive guide to meeting,dating and dumping,if necessary.By Romy Miller.
__label__1 Read The Art of Seduction instead: This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff, read The Art of Seduction:[...]I know that it's long and a bit academic in tone, but it is the last word on Seduction in the modern age. True seduction is not just a one-shot, get-laid-tonight approach (although it can certainly include that). Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire. Arm yourself with an understanding based on Greene's book, and you'll be well on your way.
__label__1 For anyone else, 4 stars. For Laura, it's her nadir.: Wishywashy cause-proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist. It's okay to buy into feminism, tree-hugging and wicca in one's personal life, but to create an album on a major label about this stuff, to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake. If you're unfamiliar with Laura Nyro, this is not the place to begin. Try "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession," "The First Songs" or pretty much anything else. Leave this one for Gloria Steinem or the next PETA convention.
__label__1 One of the worst spokeseman for my party..: Let this illogical hack please not defend my party, and makea case against the liberals. She doesn't get it, and makesso many ridiculous arguments that don't hold up.Her writing style is horrendous. Please do not wastetime on this book. I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could.
__label__2 better than the swiffer: I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
__label__2 My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!: I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop, it really picks up all of the hair, fuzz and dust. Sadly(this is why it isn't 5 stars), corners and edges will find you using a regular broom, instead of this gadget, as it just can't handle those areas. I love that I can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry -- no more mopping with anything less than clean.
__label__1 Depends on your situation: I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference, which has proven an expensive mistake. The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical.
__label__2 Does a good job: Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it's better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket. They're durable (although not as much as I'd like). I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)Also with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them. Nice!
__label__2 Works just fine, but not cheap at all: I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative.
__label__1 Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.
__label__1 Mach3 or crap3: Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave. Dont waste your money
__label__1 Somehow not as good as Birks: They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me.
__label__2 Very Nice!: My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach. It's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops.
__label__2 good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music.
__label__1 Garbage!!!: I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item, but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces. The company's response: we'll send you $50. Nice. Don't waste your time & money. Keep looking.
__label__2 Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise, with a wide range of well-crafted short stories sure to entertain any fan of the genre.A few of them resonate with the reader long after the book's finished, particularly a tale involving the history of a backwoods baptismal pool, and a married couple's slow and sweet farewell after the wife is diagnosed with a terminal illness. I'll read them again after a year or two- the ultimate compliment to a short story collection!
__label__1 Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters 19 and 21 and nothing more.
__label__1 Clapton masterpices: I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
__label__2 Long Walk to Freedom: Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland, the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled. The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound, choice of material, and blend is solid. Some collaborations work better than others. Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts. This a worthwhile introduction this group.
__label__1 slow moving, pretentious and out of date: If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic.
__label__2 A very beautiful coffee table book...: I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
__label__2 worth the wait: It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the "Biggest Prize in Sport" album, this was released by Polydor in the USA clearly with the idea of riding the cresting new wave. Sure, it was probably 999's most "commercial" album but listeners are treated to some great catchy hard rockin' songs. No, it's not punk but these guys never were really prime safety pin disciples. A very consistent album. Sing along! And what a great live band they were!
__label__1 Not as expected: Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a "regular" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it.
__label__2 Great Book on the Best Computer: This is a great book on the inventor of the Apple Computer. I have read it several times and done a couple of book reports on it. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Make sure product is for your GPS: I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX, and Amazon said people who buy this product also buy, and all the also buys were for different model GPS's and did not work with that unite, so be careful when ordering.
__label__1 Garmin 276C Power Cord: The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
__label__1 THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO: THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO, DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR, I LOST MY MONEY. I think you wrong the part, I receive Part No. RB, have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector, but no, I buy to you other cable whit 12 volt adapter cable.
__label__2 Great gift Idea--they love it!: I bought this for my grandson who loves NCIS. He was so tickled. He is collecting the series.
__label__2 another good season for an already great show: this is a solid season with several great episodes. the characterization is some of the best. it's not quite the same as we've lost Kate and gained Ziva, but the dynamics and chemistry really develop well. if you like season 1 and 2 you'll like 3 as well.
__label__2 3rd season of NCIS: This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
__label__1 Very disappointed: The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
__label__2 Season 3 is great!: Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd, the team adds 2 new members to their cast. The new director is named Jenny and has a previous relationship with Gibbs and the new agent is named Ziva.
__label__2 A feast for the ears: I have had this album, yes the hard vynl thing, since 1981. Now we can get these great works of art right on our pcs. My favorite as always been Bouree. I think this is one of the neatest pieces ever written. I love the images it invokes. Strap those head phones on and be transported into the romance of dancers in veils and moonlit desert nights.
__label__2 Law: Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
__label__1 Terribly Dissappointed: I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait, wait, wait for them to put out the Full "Real" Collector's Edition.I note that the "added for TV" scenes seem to be more personal and probably added for the ladies but weren't they in the theater version too? I seem to remember seeing the scene with Garth and his girlfriend talking at their apartment before he leaves in theater. Perhaps age is starting to show ... in me! :)
__label__2 Great flick: I took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the 70's. He was a Marine who served in the Pacific and told ne how important this battle was. I needed to have it in my collection.
__label__2 Close...: This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
__label__1 terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
__label__2 Great flick: Good movie, one of a very few on the battle of Midway. The additional storyline a Japanese love interest was distracting, however.
__label__1 Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version: If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
__label__2 Midway: I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now, it has not been sent.As for the movie, I've seen it more than once. It's a great movie. Just wish I could get it delivered. Can you help me out?
__label__2 Midway: Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans, as well as our own. I lived in that era and remember the situation very well. I would recommend this movie to all aages.
__label__1 Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none.
__label__2 A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage "Tora Tora Tora" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in "Midway". It's not like they took scenes made for "Tora Tora Tora" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit, and is always in the shadow of "Tora Tora Tora". I think, if you collect war films, you should own both. "Midway" is a true classic.
__label__1 I had a great expectation for this...: What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!
__label__2 the best: its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent , well it does not get much better then this.
__label__2 Intense, vibrant: Pure hardcore party vibes here,..with infectuous spirits that can intoxicate. Rockin' tunes include "Legalize it"' "Downpressor Man" and a fantastic "Get Up, Stand Up." Hard and fat bass lines, solid drumming and vocal chants work to induce a tribal fever and a mood to celebrate life.
__label__1 Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless "dusk till dawn" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of "Don't Answer the Phone," and "Point of Terror" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look.
__label__2 Excellent Look into African American History: I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work.
__label__1 n/a: Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
__label__1 Set of 2 40" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better.
__label__1 Cheap, and it shows.: I got these as a gift for a friend, so that we may have some fun sparring. However, one sword came with a large crease in the wood that proved to break open after only a couple hours of use. They also had a strange, chemical-y smell to them for quite a while.They can still be good display pieces, but I would recommend getting synthetic swords if you plan on seriously using them; the extra cost is worth their durability.
__label__2 Christmas present: Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
__label__2 Victum Of Sinility: Ironically, while doing an update to the catalog of my movie library, I ran across this one and decided to watch it this evening - having no recollection of it. I see that it has great review ratings from other owners, and their details I will leave to you to peruse.This is a great mystery drama. Don't miss it.Regards,EdB
__label__2 Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's 10 to midnight. This is a classic, get it while you can.
__label__2 A classic of its kind: This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies, that followed. It is not one of the best, but it still deserves five stars...
__label__1 WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED, BEAT, & TERRORIZED. OH HOW FUN...: I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day. If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you.
__label__1 Based On A True Story?: Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
__label__1 0 STARS: Talk about rubbish...you want to talk about rubbish?: Be honest people, this is not a horror movie or a scary movie...this is just pure garbage. What cinematic value does this movie have to offer? ZERO. I am all for horror movies, but this movie just is not horror, scary or even shocking...it's just lame! It is about the raping of a girl and she gets revenge. WOW, what a worthless...waste.
__label__1 Has live grain bugs: I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
__label__2 The Book of Vodou: Charms and Rituals to Empower Your Life: For such a little book, it is quite informative.I bought a copy when it was first published around 10 years ago & found myself reading & referring to it many many times. I've had an interest in Vodou for many years & like some that didn't grow up in Haiti or anyplace where Vodou is present, "The Book Of Vodou" is a great introduction.This book's is a very appealing glimpse into a beautiful religion that is often misunderstood. It has great photographs throughout & is straight & to the point about the origins & history of Vodou from West Africa all the way up to the present day without information overload.I have been a practioner of "The Arts" for many years, as well as a historian & there's not one negative thing I can say about this book. It's one of my favourite books on Vodou & in fact, I'm on my fourth copy!If you any interest in Vodou, start with this book! You will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Discover a beautiful region of France: If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey "Modestine". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known.
__label__2 Awesome: I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for, but bought the C D for a price I did not think could possible. Thanks! Love this Awesome C D.
__label__2 LOve it!: I have really curly, thich & frizzy hair. I found this product @ a local beauty supply store and LOVE it!!! I now have soft, flowing, shiny, beautiful curls. I used to need mousse, curl enhancers and tons of products to wear my curls. Since I started using this product I can just spray some leave in conditioner and I am good to walk out the door :) I usually apply it 2-3x's a wk over night and just rinse out in the morn (no shampoo).
__label__1 disappointed: i loved the original poster i lost due to a move, i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was NOT black and white but black and blue.
__label__1 Not a Great Book: I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
__label__2 Finally, I can style my own hair!: I've read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive. I have A LOT of hair. My hair is full of texture. My hair doesn't grow down (length), it grows out (wide.) I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE! I couldn't unless I wanted to look like a clown. This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair. The product does get very hot! That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however. If you don't have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you. I, however, must say FINALLY!!
__label__1 Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy.
__label__1 Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it.
__label__1 not worth it: If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least.
__label__2 Works well for thick hair if you have the time...: I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened, I don't need to do a thing with it. This product works really well for me as long as I have the time to spare. I takes me at least 30 or 40 minutes to dry and straighten my hair once it has been towel dried. I bought this product because I didn't want to spend the money for more expensive similar items. I think that for the price....the infiniti is well worth it.
__label__2 Conair Straightener: I have very thick, very wavy hair. Thie straightener works well on my hair. It is easy to use. It also does not take a week to get my hair dried. I cut my hair to shoulder length and found it does work better than on long hair, although I did get it to work on my long hair too. I am very pleased with this product. I definately recommend it.
__label__1 Does not perform the functions advertised.: This hair dryer claims to style, smooth and streighten. Don't count on it. I have medium lenghth fine hair and I wish I never bought it. However, it might work on longer hair? Not a high probability. Forget this product and empty promises.
__label__1 Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail. No power. I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it. Too late to return it. I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not. I'm generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud.
__label__1 Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.
__label__1 Baffled: I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it. Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it. I can't use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job. I used it once, didn't like it. Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn't using it right, and still wasn't thrilled. It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets.
__label__1 Disappointing at best: Sadly, I had high hopes for this little wonder, but it didn't deliver. It is difficult to maneuver and not powerful enough to blow out my short flippy style.
__label__2 Love this thing!!: I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product, if desired, after you wash, then style when your hair is about two thirds dry, or if you wash your hair at night, just dampen it a little in the AM and style.
__label__2 Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.
__label__1 Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray.
__label__2 Great ink!: A few weeks ago, I bought a few disposable fountain pens to see if I liked them, and after a few days, I began using them as my primary pens. The problem was that they had (very) bad ink in them, so when I ran out of ink, I decided to attempt to refill them with Noodler's ink-- and it worked! This stuff is pitch black, and best of all, it doesn't bleed or "feather" when you're writing with it.Works well in:Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen Assorted Ink 7-Pack Pouch (90029)
__label__1 Structurally sound but: This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3" and expand to 5" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable
__label__1 Immoral movie: This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed
__label__2 Entertaining tribute: The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and, thankfully, some fine reissues of his work. This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke. It's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists. Well worth a listen.
__label__1 They changed the words!: Don't buy this one either ... Unless you like grooving to the wrong words. I thought I was going to be sent back to the good old days ... Save your money. You won't get a refund! You can't call anyone. I got it "DRY"!
__label__1 poor product: I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
__label__1 she's so dull: She started out as the "German Britney Spears" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message, no great melody and are absolutely shallow. So is her image. She still stays "clean" (in contrast to Britney) and it extremely boring and superficial (when it comes to stardom - no meant personally)
__label__2 It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
__label__2 applied the knowladge: i have read this book with a great deal of intrest. it was a great help in implementing change and designing a organization structure that is able to deliver on the new strategy.
__label__2 akjee: the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
__label__1 A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However, after rewatching the Transformers Season 1 4 disc DVD set, this movie pales in comparison. The characters lacked personality and didn't look as interesting as the others. I recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive, but more enjoyable, DVD box sets.
__label__1 forgive me.............: Ok, ok, I realize that I am going to be fried for this but here goes.......I loved this movie as a child. I worshiped the TV series and I still have quite the collection of Autobots, and Decepticons. However, when my friend got me this film for my birthday, I watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore. I think this film better served its purpose in the 80's, and is truly lost in today's modern era of animation. I would, however, like to see this film remade with better animation, and a FAR better soundtrack. I love the toys, but I did not like this movie.
__label__2 cursing in this 80's hit movie: For those who jest cant get over the part that there was some cursing in this 80's hit movie please consider that there's was more of that in the live action movie. The same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see!!!!!.... get over it! i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in Drag too!
__label__2 MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video "The Touch" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated "Optimus Prime" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra.
__label__2 Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended.
__label__1 Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!: This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and "df -k" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season 1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible. Major disappointment, since I own the Canadian VHS version of TFTM (containg that four-letter word) and was really looking forward to owning the uncensored edition on DVD.
__label__2 One of the most beautiful creation,In the animation industry: One of best animation in 80's; A now,transformers never die, now we got the beast wars and there transformers too, Well the transformers the movie is a must have. A now, this would be interesting, how about if this was on DVD and animated in 3D computer like the beast wars, Now that would be a creation of gods.
__label__2 Best movie ever: I happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition I thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from Canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait
__label__2 The Decepticons Learn A New Skill: HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice "Edge" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase.
__label__2 Very Good: I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
__label__2 A blast from the past!: Unlike many things I used to like and am rediscovering to find I dont like as much, Transformers has only gotten better with age! Man, its like the best of western animation and japanese in an incredible amalgamation! if you've never seen the Transofrmers, don't be influenced by their bastardized offspring, beast wars, this cartoon was and is great!
__label__1 disappointed by this board game: I bought this game because it promised a "green" experience for the entire family. i must say, i was highly disappointed. is it called "green" because you are dealing with vegetables? So be it. My family could not find any interest in this game, not even my four year old whom we bought the game for. I did not find the added value of this game. don't waist your money on this.
__label__2 BEST MUTI VITAMINS IN THE MARKET: For Years i been taking it yes your urine may turn yellow i have orange label and sometimes if you eat it with food your stomach might hurt but its life its a good vitamins A C E D The best! I Rec People To Try This Vitamin
__label__1 Evolution is true: Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it.
__label__2 one of the most beautiful songs: this song is about lyrics, lyrics, lyrics. and leigh nash's beautiful vocals.i loved the bounce movie, but this song is more beautiful. actually, its one of our "songs" for my boyfriend and I. i think it should have recieved radio play, but i don't think it did. my favorite version of this song is the movie mix, which is more like and extended version. the only song i did not like is walking with strangers which is not sung by leigh nash. i just did not connect with it at all.need to be next to you is a good song for all you hopeless romantic types. the music video is really cool, it has images from the movie, which enhances what i just said about being a hopless romantic.. so with that being said i give 4 out of 5
__label__1 this movie is available on iTunes!!!: it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
__label__2 Clear, Concise - What All Programming Books Should Be!: Those wishing to shift into the .NET phase will thoroughly enjoy Petzold's Key of C#. Not only does it teach the fundamentals clearly, it builds off the fundamentals with a clever approach to programming. Programming in the Key of C# promotes experimentation and critical thinking.
__label__1 I have such a Tooth-Ache: This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it, I got a tooth-ache. I am surprised they didn't go back and save Political leaders and the like. Enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought, and wasted screen time. I should have rented it on video. Not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre. TOO LONG. Rent it, make popcorn, take a break every 20-30 minutes, you're good to go.
__label__1 Unsatisfactory: I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair.
__label__2 a thriller of what if times meet.: very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
__label__2 Intelligent and heart-wringing: This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid, who puts in a great performance, I like this film for its unabashed good storytelling. It is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters. Moreover, apart from the usual coincidence thing, the science fiction plot doesn't have holes. May you enjoy this movie as much as I did!
__label__2 Illogical But Wonderful: Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie, a re-connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio, you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes. That doesn't prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat-out emotional performances by Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors. Look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene. Some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb.This film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws.Walmer Road in Toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in Queens, N.Y.
__label__2 Fun Science Fiction: This movie is a feel good, science fiction movie with a murder mystery and plenty of action woven into it.
__label__1 FRequency: Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty.
__label__2 A great character!: Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers, I expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon, and got Paydirt with a capital 'P'. Vinge's creation, whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice, is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all-time. Read the book and find out why.
__label__2 Enjoyable book: I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
__label__2 excellant: this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw,it was warm and funny and so true of Loretta Lynn,full of truth and surprises
__label__1 The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended.
__label__2 Solitary Witch: I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one, I just like it. There is some information that I take and refer back to (elements, Witches' Pyramid, etc), but I know that there's more to my Path. I wouldn't say that she's "Fluffy" only because she puts witchcraft in terms so teenagers can understand it. There are things that I don't agree with, but all-in-all it's a good reference.)O(
__label__2 LOVE: Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
__label__2 Our favorite game, by far.: Cooperative games help keep the peace at our house and this is the one we play the most. We have so much fun working together to try to beat the robber--no tears at the end of this game!
__label__1 If you buy this, you're buying s**t. Literally.: I love Marilyn Manson!But... after watching this movie, I had a change of thoughts. If you like to see band members vomiting, band members deficating, and then playing with it, people rubbing stuff against their bare naked d*ck, and other profanity, you should buy this movie. I thought it would just be a movie of their tour, but it's a bunch of s**t. Stick to the CD's. By the way, I think Courtney put a hell of a show on at the tour! Manson... a bit sick. I still think that Manson kicks, but some of the stuff he does just disgustes me so much, and makes me think just what he's puting in the minds of our youth today. You think about it. The shootings at that school for instance...
__label__1 Tank top: I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
__label__1 Worthless: Doesn't fit the average 10" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround, doesn't even reach subwoofer basket. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy, I am completely shocked that someone can produce a DVD like this one and call it "Tai Chi". It is not even half way close.The demonstrator didn't even get his movement right. In fact the content of the DVD is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly Asian: primary school morning exercise, some basic Yoga breathing and postures, some partial Tai Chi gesture. Coming from an Asian background, I almost felt this is an insult.If you are serious about learning Tai Chi, don't get misled by this DVD.
__label__1 Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...: I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout, i'm done in 15! The 60 minute program is more like 40.i think of all of the tutorials, i have seen only 1 all the way through and most, it just skips over them. It is horrible! I tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good.
__label__1 Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the "responsible" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's "Whenis it right to Fight? Never", available from Pilgrim Brethren Press, po box 171, Petersburg, Ohio 44454. Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me.
__label__1 Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind.
__label__2 Lee plays the good guy!: This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher, of the English countryside, will give you a warm fuzzy until the final clash between good and evil.
__label__1 merlin: not that good. script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better, especially in a review
__label__1 Did not speak to me, prefer "Peaceful Warrior" series: How to write a review about a book that does not speak to you? Difficult. While I liked "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge" (at least the first part) somehow "Journey to Ixtlan" did not speak to me at all. It came across as boring, meaningless walking and dialogues in desert without wisdom revealing to me.I certainly preferred the whole Dan Millman's "Peaceful Warrior" series with spiritual wisdom weaved into interesting adventures.
__label__2 The Court Jester: Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children, but at his best, brought out the child in all of us. A hilarious spoof on the swashbuckler picture, "The Court Jester" is widely regarded as his finest screen hour. With lots of color, action and excitement framing the immortal gags, this is family entertainment at its best .
__label__1 Worst film ever?: By film's end, I was hoping the Driller Killer would show up to put Telly and Capser out of their misery. In the end, the only people you truly feel sorry for, is the man on the subway with no legs and the skater punk who gets beaten nearly to death.
__label__1 Horrible: I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens, and the story of a group of moron teenagers who thinks its cool to be going around drinking, smoking, engaging in brutal fights with people and other acts of vandalism, having sex with girls between the age of 12 and 15, and stealing from their parents.This was a huge waste of an hour and a half. I only gave this movie 1 star because amazon doesn't allow me to give it 0.If you are looking for a movie that offers the story of troubled teens, and is GOOD, Thirteen is the movie you wanna watch.
__label__1 Yuck, Yuck, Yuck: I hated this movie. SO unrealistic. Sure, maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating. But I AM a teenager in a city. NOBODY acts like this!What the hell is the point of this movie? To scare the crap out of parents?Also, the rape scene was vile. At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn't even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing.
__label__2 This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.
__label__2 Great movie?: This movie was pretty good, though there is a lot of sex, drugs, drinking, violence etc... I'm from NYC and some ppl i know are like that i think it shows what teen life is like for some ppl in NY. I loved how they used Washington Sq. Park-a lot of ppl that are like the charaters in the movie go to that park for the same reasons... skateboard, pick fights, do drugs etc.... This movie seemed so real and i hope there would be more movies like this. -14
__label__2 excellent movie: This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
__label__2 Real-life look into the life of teens: This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these "KIDS". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens.
__label__2 dream: I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw "Bully" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending, what goes around comes around.
__label__2 Not A KIDS Movie: Being a teen boy I wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks. To my disappiontment there wasn't any. Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce "Casper", the blonde boy at the guys house that was shaking, and kid urinating near Casper are hot. We get to see all of them shirtless. If you get the Widescreen DVD on the far left you can see Justin's behind in a graphic rape/sex scene. RIP Justin I will miss you...you were so hot.
__label__2 Nice Debut: Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff, give it a listen.
__label__1 Pretty but not made well: They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
__label__1 something u would'nt expect: this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything, you should see 100 girls. I dont think this movie should have even been made.
__label__2 Our Father Abraham: Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior, who worshiped in a synagogue, honored and practiced Jewish rituals. We read from a Jewish book, our Bible written by Jewish men. To fully understand the symbolism in the Bible we must know something about Jewish religeous practices.Christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in Judaism This book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of Jewish culture and religeon. I highly reccomend this book to all Christains wishing to have a deeper understanding of their faith and its beginnings.
__label__1 Never got it, never heard from them: I never received this product and have not heard from the vendor except to ask for a review.
__label__1 BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.
__label__1 Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards: A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
__label__1 It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read: Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring. I can't believe this is called a classic. Its terrible and the educators at certain high schools should not force this book upon kids--it lowers their grades and intelligence.
__label__2 Love it!: The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
__label__2 Never becomes passe!: I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to "dazzle you with her footwork". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there.
__label__1 Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific.
__label__1 Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best.
__label__1 Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie "Clueless". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.
__label__2 What's the fuss about Jane Austen?: I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen. Her writing is adroit, and paints an intriguing picture of her times. She illustrates the psychology of a historic culture, but....I just don't find her all that wonderful. I realize I'll be stoned by all the Jane Austen fans out there, but THERE IT IS.
__label__1 Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain. I think Jane Austen was right when she said " no one but myself will much like [Emma]."
__label__2 Great Book!: This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book. The plot is ingenious, and the characters are hilarious. Dover does a good job of publishing, and this book is no exception. I highly recommend Emma!
__label__1 I Hate Emma: I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
__label__1 Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention.
__label__2 Austen sparkles as always, but this is no Pride and Prej!: Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat "Northanger Abbey") can match the high standards set by "Pride and Prejudice". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as "Pride and Prejudice"--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste.
__label__1 Rubbish: What rubbish.Way too much violence. Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days? (or when it was made).Had a few laughs (I'm an ex-pat Australian) but not worth the plastic it was made from.Certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows.
__label__2 Bernard and Miss Bianca Do It Again!: In Disney's "The Rescuers Down Under," Rescue Aid Society mice Bernard and Miss Bianca travel to Australia to help Mara Houte, the golden eagle. With the assistance of Wilbur, an albatross, and numerous other friends encountered along the way (such as a wise-cracking kangaroo rat), they hurry to help the endangered bird. Voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Miss Bianca) and John Candy (Wilbur) move the story along at a good pace. George C. Scott provides voice for the villain, a bounty hunter of endangered animals. Scott's sidekick is a goanna lizard called Joana - and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man. A sidebar plot is Bernard's plan to propose marriage to Miss Bianca ... and all of the things that conspire to get in the way. This is a nice movie for the entire family, and one with a good message. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 cave twins review from grandkids.: Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was " Wow Wicked Brilliant !"
__label__1 Incorrect information in this book: I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
__label__1 Negative review - too basic and not too helpful: The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the "don't buy" list on our bulletin board!
__label__2 A "MUST READ" for all Home Inspectors!: This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
__label__1 This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
__label__1 Garbage - Avoid: The dimensions indicate 1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
__label__1 freely available: Since those responsible for this animated version of "Animal Farm" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending.
__label__2 The Best Bible Story Book We Own!: We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, "What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?", because they so look forward to reading this book.
__label__1 Skip this author!: I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author.
__label__2 I Love It!!: I love this book. I am almost done the series. It is an amazing book! There is a huge series coming after this book, three other series! I hope you like it! Rachael at age 11and1/2 :}
__label__2 The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books. The begining of the story of Rusty, the so-called kittypet, who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end, who came from Firepaw to Fireheart, the ThunderClan warrior!
__label__2 i love this book: this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
__label__2 Great book: Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
__label__2 A great book!: I'm sorry to give you this late response because I read this book today. This was an excellent book! I would recommend everyone to read this book. This book inspired me about not giving up on your goal.
__label__2 ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS ON EARTH!!!!!: I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers,dog lovers,horse lovers,any kind of lover! After reading this I bought the rest of the series,and I know you'll love it too!! I SAY IT SHOULD BE AWARDED THE NEWBERY HONOR AWARD!!! Read this book to find how Rusty, a kittypet (a house cat) finds his destiny to become a great warrior!A #1 Fan,Kierstyn (Forestfur)
__label__2 Great!: Oh, this series is so good! I am waiting impatiently for the 6th one to come out, and so i am reading all the other ones over and over again. And I've just learned that there is to be a new series of Warriors. All new characters and clans! Stone clan, sky clan, and some other ones I forgot. it's called Midnight and is coming out next year on March. I'm going to pre-order mine's now!
__label__2 LOVE IT!!: Okay, first off I'll tell you that all the books in the series (there are four main series, then a couple "in-between" books) are GREAT! However, it gets to be too much. Remembering all the names, what Clan they come from, who their mate is, who there kits are, who their friends/enemies are, who their brothers and sisters are, it's too much!But, I'm not here to bag on the books, I read the first one because a bunch of my friends were going on and on about them, it's a couple weeks later, and I'm just finishing The Last Omen, sooo... I don't know if that says anything other than I LOVE WARRIORS!!!!
__label__2 AMAZING: As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
__label__1 plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws, let me know):Nick wasn't sure how it started. Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor, but then choked and had to sit up. One of the girls pointed at him mockingly, but it wasn't mockery, she was laughing uncontrollably herself. Nat was red in the face, pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it. Nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor, and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively, it was like hiccups, it was hiccups, all mixed up together with the whooping, inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle, the Renoir lady, the gilded plaster crown above the bed, all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections.
__label__1 Not worth it: After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall.
__label__2 My Comfort Book: This book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years. From Diapers to trucks and fighting, I found what I needed to know in these pages. I am now sending copies to my three neices who have just had boys of their own. Truly trans-generational!
__label__1 Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period.
__label__1 Awful movie.: Amazing, but the name is the most redeeming quality of this movie. The "chain gang" is comprised of MEN, and only men. Men escape from a chain gang with a little help from two women. Acting is okay to bad, quality is okay to bad, story is okay to bad.
__label__2 social scientists, take your medecine!: Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on. To be frank, I think Sowell's arguments are sometimes thin (much social engineering is done well and is necessary), but it is always good to read someone who will challenge convention, especially when that person is as bright as Sowell is.
__label__2 Sowell is the soul of our time: This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as "constrained" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes.
__label__2 Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
__label__2 a must have: This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never " stacked " more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing, nor I had any difficulty climbing my bike. I suggest buying it with your cycleops unit.
__label__1 they are posers: i bet you 10$ that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink182 listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties
__label__2 This is a great CD: This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink, or just wnat to listen to some awsome pop/punk music, I suggest that you go out and by this album. I also suggest that you go out and see MEST aoon. I've seen them twice and they put on a kick-butt... show.
__label__2 Mest above all: Mest is the greatest band of all time, I highly recommend that you go out and buy the Waisting Time CD, you will not be disappointed...
__label__2 Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet.
__label__2 Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)
__label__2 I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert, and they're awesome. Tony is great. This is the 3rd CD and I think it's pretty kickass. Sure, some of the songs aren't so lyrically great, but it's fun to listen to. The songs that stand out are "Drawing Board" (who doesn't like this song?) "Cadillac" (for you people with some ghetto in you) and "Yesterday" (vocals by Jeremiah, sounds awesome).Some of the weirder songs are "Reason" and the hidden track. They're both cool, just...too jamacian. Oh well, I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever, get this CD.Whether they're punk, pop-punk, or pop-rock, they're good.
__label__2 Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics, sick riffs, and a band with a totally cool attitude, this, in my opinion, is their best to date, with their self titled in second and mo money mo 40'z in third. The only album from Mest that i didnt really like was wasting time, but it still wasn't that bad...
__label__2 Kick [behind] BAND!!!!: Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
__label__2 Third and other streams: Well, since other jazz-fans (mr. Dennis, mr. Chell, mr. Lampereta...) have already given quite elaborate and diverse arguments in favor of this intriguing album (plus some sophisticated counterarguments as well), I will only add a small voice in their favor and another five stars to match it...Cool and third-streamish jazz is not really my thing, but this is such a great collection of diverse, beautifully performed and arranged music that I'm left really impressed. Naturally, Lovano shines through like a real jazz-giant he obviously is.
__label__1 Junk -- will flood your kitchen: Expensive and works for less than 3 years, at which time it will flood your kitchen. I've had two dispensers and both flooded the kitchen. How this product stays on the market is beyond me.
__label__2 This is my second time purchasing this item: I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
__label__2 *THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else.It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters 12 and 13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter 12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET
__label__1 Hoping, But NO: Was hoping other reviews were off, but unfortunately they were right. Not even close to a recommended movie. Or as would be said by submariners, a true "Five finger gagger".
__label__1 90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
__label__2 Accurate: I bought this to help me when I started school to get my degree in political science and it proved to behelpful along with another book I bought for the same reason. I use them to decipher anything I am not clear on. Drink water when using this book because it's good for you,
__label__2 Mountain of contemplation: great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for "the way of the pilgrim"
__label__2 Excellent for everybody: My 8 months baby loves it!!!, he may not fully understand what's all about but you can run it a couple of times a day and he sits there still to watch, recomended for everyone
__label__2 sesame street: Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes, when she gets toddling she'll being dancing to it. The music, flashy colors and movement will keep any child entertained no matter what their age.
__label__2 Great historical novel: This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate "How to" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.
__label__1 Duplicates others: Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks. See comparative review here:Ulysses
__label__2 A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human.
__label__2 i love it: I am very satisfied and I like it, i think....the shipping cost is a little expensive for me...( because i do not live in USA^^)anyway ..thank you & Mary Christmas!!!
__label__1 Habent sua fata libelli: That book has a luck. It's the worst book which has ever been written. Strangely, there are some people who think it is the best one. that's what the latin phrase (above) means
__label__1 Ulysses: This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
__label__1 Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow. I don't think it would be right for me to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I think it is worth a try. I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea.
__label__1 Italics are capitalized: Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line.
__label__1 Dirty and cheap: Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in? The case weighs about 1 oz and is ready to fall apart. The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty--covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt. The chips themselves are OK, without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn't worth much. Of course its made in China and you get what you pay for.
__label__1 not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..: i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like 11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
__label__2 High quality, casino-grade poker chip set: Casino-quality chip set. Heavy-duty case. Set is very heavy -- accounts for the high shipping charge.
__label__1 Poor Quality: The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
__label__1 These Shows Have All Been Edited: All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather" NOT " have something than have shows the way these are.
__label__2 Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin: I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin, its almost the same as being in a live class.
__label__1 There are better flash cartooning books out there!: In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12, 13, 14 and 15. My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave. I prefer "Flash 5 Cartooning" and "Flash Cartoon Animation: Learn From The Pros" over this book.
__label__1 Is book true?: In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany, it shows the dates 1942-1943, but the invasion of Europe never happend until June 1944. Please explain.
__label__2 Not Just Brokaw: I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly.
__label__1 Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights,and that occurs in the first scene. Unfortunately,it's all downhill from there. A big chunk of the movie isparodies of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Tryingto parody a classic comedy is like going to karaoke night andtrying to sing a Celine Dion song. At best, it's tolerable.Worst case scenerio, well.... you get the idea. Nowhere nearas funny as the Scary Movie movies.
__label__1 Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped.
__label__1 A very, very bad movie: I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.
__label__1 One of the worst out there.: Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that's all.Date Movie is a spoof of romantic comedies. Simply that idea sounds good right? The writers had alot to work with, but they failed miserably. Alyson Hannigan plays the main character, Julia Jones. Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop.This might be enjoyed by some, but only a few. For me, a big comedy fan, it was pretty bad in general.I actually watched it at the theaters and, my friends, it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life! It is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again...Ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie.One measly star *
__label__1 Torture to watch: I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a "field trip" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like "Saturday Night Live") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real "Date Movie".
__label__1 always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...: The movie was funny the first, oh lets say about maybe the first 20-40 minutes. After that the movie is garbage. The humor and mocking was so dis-tasteful and a little offensive. The cat in the bathroom, "dead mrs.jones", the little jokes by the bachellor's parents, the bizarre family relationships, and the mock-sexual references to sex.I was very surprised at myself when i viewed the film. I hardly laughed and didnt laugh when I needed. Like I said I totally love these not another teen movie, scary movie type films...but Date Movie is pure garage. The humor is so awful and the mockery sucks tooBottom line: Horrible movie...never watching it again.
__label__1 Dated and Dull: This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin, but the bare skin they show ain't worth seein'. This stuff got better in the 80s, when there was ample supply of attractive, and less inhibited women.
__label__1 Worst movie in history: Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
__label__2 great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green, depending on the lighting, people can see your eyes, this happens about % of the time. outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great.
__label__2 Tony B -- New Chairman of the Board: If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board, Tony Babino will be considered President and CEO of the company. From the opening chord of this CD, you'll be very, very impressed with Tony B's powerhouse vocals. He belts out the standard, "I've Got The World On A String" with a livelier arrangement, to a heartfelt rendition of "And I Love Her". If you think he might be another cover artist, you'll be wrong. Tony B writes his own songs as well. He wrote 4 of the 14 tracks on this CD. Some of his own compositions like "50 Years" and "Sentimental Heartstrings" are better than some standards. This is a superb CD. You'll definitely, without a doubt, enjoy this CD. As the title suggests...you'll be "Swingin' Around with Tony B." for a long time to come.
__label__2 Fun Family Film!: I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
__label__2 Houseboat: This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper, Loren helps Grant to change his priorities, be less of a jerk, and bond with his children. This takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river. Grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch. Loren is the Italian beauty (thought she was ugly when I was a child)that falls in love with Grant and brings the family together.
__label__2 a very meaningful and entertaining movie: Saw the bachelor in the cinema,It did not fail to keep me smiling and laughing through the whole show.it show that money really can't get you true love.It is a guy sincerelyty that had touch the girl's heart.And at the last part of the movie when one whole bunch of brides chasing after the guy in the movie ,boy it was a real fancinating moment I ever seen,never had I seen such phenomenon ever.After all this is really a good movie to keep you entertain for two hours.worth watching.
__label__1 Not much redeeming value: I don't mind implausible stories, but only if the film makers can pull it off. I was sad to discover that Chris O'Donnell can't act. I hadn't noticed before because he was well cast in a few other roles, but fortunately never had to carry a story. Part of the problem might go to the director. In fact the director is highly suspect. The timing was off and there is no evidence that the man in charge had any clear view of what he wanted to bring out in the characters or storyline. I was sorry I spent the money on the rental. Don't bother.
__label__1 Difficult Viewing: This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
__label__2 Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.: This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album, The Fixing to Die Rag, is less raucous than the Woodstock version of that song and still a good version, with the advantage that I can play this one for the grand kiddies without their grandmother going ballistic. For a long time this album was only available at great cost but now it has been republished at a reasonable price and is worth considering.
__label__1 Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started "snapping" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ...
__label__1 Refund: This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
__label__1 Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
__label__2 Coconutheads: I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky, I think) is outrageous, mixing in jazzy, moody tones with great skill. The band has had some personnel changes, but the core members have stayed intact, although I miss the live drummer.
__label__2 great product: it's the best lube i've used so far, just a bit expensive and that's the only thing wrong with it
__label__2 Good Product - Stains can be dealt with: I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However, when I contacted Pjur Customer Service, they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation. That did in fact get out the stains.
__label__1 It is greasy: I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
__label__1 There are better lubes by FAR!: We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife, so we will not try this again.
__label__2 Love it!: i LOVED this movie! i watched it in my English class and LOVED it! it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome. you never get bored, it has stuff for everyone in it. whether you like Romance, Action, Humor...it is all in there! i really enjoyed it =]
__label__2 The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!
__label__2 Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other 15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!
__label__1 Romeo & Juliet: The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
__label__2 the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse.
__label__1 But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS.
__label__1 More Groans Than Laughs: Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice.
__label__1 Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!
__label__2 A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many "American principles." Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it.
__label__2 Love this movie!: I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
__label__1 Not Just "Borderline" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your "Lucky Star" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called "movie" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than "Body of Evidence" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it. I want my two hours back.
__label__1 Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level.
__label__2 Great Movie, But...: The storyline was superb. Rupert was great. But Madonna...what were you thinking??? Her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie. Is she American??? Is she English??? The cross between sounds Australian which is irritating. Apart from Madonna's terrible acting, this movie is held together pretty well.
__label__1 Bad: The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
__label__2 An amazing fun MOM book: This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though, it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband, kids, and other moms. I read this book in about a day. It was too good to put down.shannon
__label__1 Not the Planet of the Apes: This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film, it was close to a modern day Gulliver's Travels, raising questions about how we treat animals, our science and our society.This will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film, which is okay hokum. Excepting the massive holes in the plot of the recent movie... How did horses arrive on the planet? Where were the non-chimps on the station etc?
__label__2 Wonderful perspective shift!: After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face, this was a wonderful and refreshing perspective. Teenage girls who are self-confidant, not worried about pleasing others with who they are, eloquent, etc. How encouraging! I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling...
__label__1 ???: Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good! Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!
__label__1 HORRIBLE, WASTE OF TIME!: This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. None of the research from the Bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in. Can Katz even do a reasonable job at researching information? It doesn't even deserve one star.
__label__1 Women leave for all the same reasons: I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship.
__label__1 Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT.
__label__1 pretty bad: If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad.
__label__1 This should have been a good movie...: but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the "Mortal Kombat" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor.
__label__2 The Mummy Returns: I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the 1st film.
__label__1 Forgot to mention this...: But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way, this movie on the whole. Was not very good and was a bit way too campy.
__label__1 the mummy returns: I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again.
__label__1 ryan hickneys mummy review: this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
__label__1 Don't buy this DVD: Unless you want to line Universal's pocket, I'd advise you to stay away from this video.Don't get me wrong though, I like the movie. It's pretty good escapist entertainment. I don't try to read to much into such movies. It was fun. But Universal is most likely going to release this title in an Ultimate Edition package just like the last one. They also created Ultimate Editions for American Pie, Meet Joe Black and a few others. So if you like this movie wait for the Ultimate Edition.
__label__2 Great Special Effects: Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
__label__1 It stunk: This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
__label__1 What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions.
__label__2 Good short history: Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN: 1-881366-01-4170 pages, maps, pictures, indexI found this book in the bookstore at Wilson's Creek and bought it immeadlty. Ed Bearss' narration captures the immediacy of the situation, placing you on the line. This small book will not disappoint the reader there and will convey solid information about the battle. The balance between detail and narration is maintained throughout the book. Neither takes over and we end with a short but very solid history.
__label__1 OK as a monocular, not a binocular: I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice.
__label__1 RE: Mission Impossible: By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.The TV series is far superior.
__label__1 Impossible: Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie, and finding anything comprehensible about the plot. Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is.
__label__1 Such shit: This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget, small art. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
__label__1 I was dissappointed: Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all.
__label__2 Nice Family Drama: This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
__label__2 Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight, a labor of love about Mexico. It's a travel book that is actually fun to read. It's also full of useful information about just about everything; how to travel, where to stay, how to stay healthy, how to deal with the law, some basics on the language, and much more. And every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience, some of it painful, most of it joyful.What it is not is a book listing all the hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, and so forth. (There is a short section - The Best of Mexico - with specific suggestions, but it's just a starting point.) If your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors, this may be the only book you need. If you like a little more structure, you will want to supplement it with traditional guidebooks for the areas you plan to visit.
__label__2 Book was a marvel of technical details and fiction: Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way, Bravo!
__label__1 Brittle Fail: These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it
__label__2 Just what I was looking for!: This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic, and somehow soothing. The images within are simply elegant. Lovely, and highly recommended!
__label__2 Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off, you're out of luck. This one is different. It has a backup "mini-buzzer" alarm that will go off at the set alarm time even if you have the alarm set to radio. I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to wake up late. It's comforting knowing I don't have to worry about the power being out and the alarm not sounding.
__label__2 WING FLY HIGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored, all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great.
__label__2 Yes, It Is Better: Of all McCartney's lost albums, this is the one that most richly deserves to be found. Old Siam Sir sits with other forgotten Mccartney classic rockers such as Girls' School, Soily and The Mess all of which fit neatly with the best Rock and Roll he wrote for that other group (in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them). Arrow Through Me is one of those delicate pieces that McCartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way. The Rockestra highlights work well on this album, but are perhaps better on Concert for Kampuchea. The generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of Wings Mark 3. Give it a listen, you want be disappointed, particularly if you like the better moments on the Mccartney album
__label__2 Excellent: All the Nancy Drew books are excellent - perfect to develop a 8 or 9 year olds love for reading. The stories are all so interesting. We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B. Jones have main characters that I would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes, etc. Nancy Drew is not afraid of ANYTHING or ANYONE and is always finding adventure while solving mysteries.
__label__2 Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.
__label__1 disturbing: We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
__label__1 BEWARE: This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child, I myself found it highly disturbing. Although the pictures are cute, I would never allow my child to read it.
__label__1 Magic Thumb Tip: The thumb is very small (more for a child than an adult) and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick. Would absolutely not recommend this product at all.
__label__2 Meooooooooww: When I read this title I thought it was going to be a funny story but WOWWW was it so much more. This is the sexiest story I have every read. Dammmmmm
__label__2 A classic which keeps you guessing.: The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries, here it is.
__label__2 Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.: I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!
__label__2 Yes, good movies are still being made!!!!!: With today's current crop of movies, it is easy to think that quality films that make you think might have gone the way of the dodo. However, The Insider is a BIG exception to the rule. Don't let the long running time or the fact that it may seem like any other A & E documentary discourage you. This movie is potboiler that keeps you glued to the screen and howling at every the injustice of it all.One of the greatest compliments for this movie would have to be the fact that I watched it with five of my friends who could care less about current events or journalistic integrity, yet all of them sat through every single minute of it absolutely riveted to the screen.It is kind of discouraging seeing the self-censorship and the "chilling effect" on the media that's taken place since the events of the film. However, the film ends on a high note and is well worth watching if you enjoy great cinema!
__label__2 Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
__label__2 the best: i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years, i narrowed it down to amadeus, private ryan, manchurian candidate (frank sinatra), high noon and no country. after everything shakes out, THE INSIDER would have to top the list. acting, directing, music, script and subject matter. i just wish it was on blu ray.
__label__2 Riveting: Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it, Mann's film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world. Truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience. On a lesser note, I also think it is something really unique when big-budget Hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story. Cheesy as it may sound, I believe a film like this is much closer to gargantuan filmaking than... well let's justs say GLADIATOR.
__label__1 Pretty much a waste of time: The story itself, which is based on real events, is interesting but the filmmakers made it into a weak feature film. There is too much unnecessary information and the "60 minutes" peoples' portrayal is too harsh. Some scenes are repeated during the film and the overall dialogue can [at times] put you to sleep.I give this film two stars instead of one because of Russel Crowe's superb acting.
__label__1 Not What I Expected: This books has loads of information, but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one's attention. I would not purchase this again.
__label__2 to dream of love: This movie is unique and beautiful. Especially the character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).Still reeling from its beauty, which really, was in all the little details. It was made like a dream, some characters over the top, some more real than real.See it if you can.
__label__1 The Emperor Has No Clothes: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid.
__label__2 great buy, great hair and skin!: I bought this for myself, and upon using it just once the difference in my skin and hair was obvious. No itching or dryness! I promptly bought another for my mother- she is in her 80s and has said this has helped her skin and hair so much. We gave them as gifts to many people in 08, and every one of them has gone on to buy one to give as a gift to someone they love too. Honestly; easy to install, easy to use, instant results- great value for money!
__label__2 My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I don't need to epilate again for at least a month easily. I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.
__label__2 Awsome: I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it.
__label__2 First epilator I've used: I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.
__label__2 Looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything?: Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad, 79 years young. Finding anything for him, that he hasn't seen, heard or done is very difficult. Imagine my surprise when he sent me a note stating this was the BEST gift he'd received in a long time! I also bought him "the Evolution of Useful Things"... same message! Both are super-duper gifts!
__label__1 To engineer is human - I engineered a new beverage coaster!: I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore, after the recommendation from a professor at another institution.Petroski's prose is extremely dense and verbose. His style consists of run-on sentences which require several readings. Even if it is technically (grammatically) correct, it is extremely difficult to read. The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it. I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us. I successfully engineered Petroski's book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting $14 on this book.
__label__1 Save yourself the time...: The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however, the content of the book leaves a lot to be desired. What could have been accomplished in one chapter is drawn out repeatedly to cover 200 pages. Very boring. Overall message is one of merit, but too much repetition.
__label__1 Had SO much potential....: I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen.
__label__1 I liked the backcover blurb, but...: This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Although they appeared to be working (they glowed, and we'd hear the occasional ZAP) it didn't take 6 months before one of them completely stopped glowing, and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population - the reason we bought them. Not worth it at all.
__label__1 Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
__label__1 Poor stitching, doesn't hold up: I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed
__label__2 Works with AVIC-D3: The new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable, and this was the solution to the problem. Now my 4th gen nano charges no problem!
__label__2 (3.8)stars still good: This is not like their first two albums but it's still heavy.They don't have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it's still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess.This is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing.If you own their first two albums just know this,there's more clean singing,nick doesn't have the deathcore growls anymore,and not as brutal but yeah still brutal.So i can't say you might not like this but there's is some good heavy songs is okay.
__label__2 So far - très bon: AS described, but I think you need to know some French before you can use this product effectively.
__label__1 Is it over yet?: After 4 months of trying to plow through this book, I finally gave up on page 121 and read the last page. I kept hoping things would get better; The pace would pick up and I might care about these people. To no avail. A thourough disappointment. start to abbreviated finish.
__label__1 Crap: with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good, but no they made it online only or one player so no internet no fun. it's not worth it, buy any other burnout except this one. and if you want to have fun wreaking cars and people get (Saints Row The Third) or (Grand Theft Auto) you can drive around getting into all sorts of trouble. Not a bad idea the open land driving but we see that in the GTA's this is Burnout the open land should be the addition
__label__2 You're Gonna This Book: This book is a must read!!!! but not unless you've read City Of Masks and City of Stars. Hoffman creates and incredible world in (unfortunately) the last installment of this AMAZING series. You'll want to stay in Talia forever. This book had the perfect combination of love, adventure, suspense, and wit. For those of you who read the first 2 books to me City of Flowers was very shocking but in a good way. *****
__label__1 We Are The World meets Journey: When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
__label__1 TV goes out after 90 days: We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what, it only has a 90 day warranty on labor. And the labor is $60!!! Don't buy it.
__label__2 Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom "Dharma and Greg"), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike.
__label__2 Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian, a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations. When their friend Anna visits them, both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths.This is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast. Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around, but Keeping the Faith does pretty well. The plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end, but Ben Stiller and Edward Norton keep it afloat pretty well.This is a pretty good movie, so I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon.
__label__2 Love it!: This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors, especially Edward Norton, but they all did beautifully. It was refreshing to see Ben Stiller in a more serious, yet still comedic movie.
__label__2 A good collection but......: This collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track "Desperado", it includes the #1 single in Italy "Movin' On" which was originally released in 1984, the beautiful ballads "Dreamland Paradise", "Leaving Now" and "Smile", and the amazing "Excessive Love". All the other tracks are pop-dance songs. They did many other songs that are not included here as the pop-jazz "Broadway", the beautiful semi new age ballad "Shine" and many others.
__label__2 After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad, though typical of the time it came out, as far as sound, photography, SPFX and acting, though the four leads were great: Randy Quaid, the beautiful Kate Capshaw (this was only her second film), Max Von Sydow and of course Christopher Plummer. It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch. I could barely recall anything of it since I'd seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder. I recommend this to anyone looking for 99 minutes to kill if they've nothing else to do.Unintentional funny moment: When the paramedics try reviving a dead Mrs. Matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her.
__label__2 Suprisingly enjoyable: "Blow" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of "blow" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding "Blow" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.
__label__1 DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films.
__label__1 Great movie!: I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
__label__2 Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story: The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a "big" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other, etc.It's absolutely worth viewing.
__label__1 Heavy handed: While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical exposÉ. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.
__label__1 Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun, and worth repeat viewing. I only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude. Compared to the first two episodes, "Los Angeles" is lamentably lame. Skip it.
__label__1 Please no more!: The third installment of Crocodile Dundee starring a subdued Paul Hogan takes place this time in Los Angeles,where he somehow finds an plot do steal some paintings. The ever lovable guy from 'downunder', is less lovable and more pathetic looking this go around. I know he's getting older, but did this second sequal really need to be made? The script and plot are something not even a t.v. movie of the week would show. Like the old saying, " Don't fix it if it aint broken". Well it's broken, but please Hollywood, don't try and fix it!
__label__1 Not the Buddy Holly I know and love: My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK, and I don't like it. I'm a Buddy Holly fan, but sound quality is poor, and it doesn't compare to his later recordings in terms of arrangements and singing style. Not my cup of tea.
__label__1 Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first: This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
__label__2 Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short, it is one of the classics.
__label__2 read it for your own reaction.: This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life, and you feel the need to change your own.
__label__2 Profound, Poetic, and Disturbing: A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of "getting by." Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. "Effect" instead of "Cause." The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's "fiancee" or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be "Cause." Not "Effect." Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply "getting by.&quot
__label__2 L'Etranger, The Stranger: I picked up The Stranger expecting the worst. With a sigh I sat down to read it, and about an hour later, I put it down. I sighed again, shrugged and then ate lunch. At dinner, I told my father that I had finished reading it, and my reaction to the text. He grinned and waved his fork. "That's exactly what Camus was writing about." Confused, I read the book again. And this time, I liked it. The more I read it, the easier it was to understand. I felt connected to the characters, and sympathized with the events in thier lives. The Stranger nows has a special space in my bookcase.
__label__2 A Good Classic: I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
__label__2 goth background research: "and the stranger - the killing of an arab"It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music.
__label__1 SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence.
__label__2 Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.
__label__2 Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school, and I devoured every word of it. Albert Camus should be read by every student of literature,history, and philosophy. His prose is fluid, his style uncompromising. He reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has. Camus earned his place in the French literary canon. It is time that the American literary canon adds him among their elite as well. I hope to read this novel again, but in French.
__label__2 Great Book, I couldn't put it down: After you get a few chapters into the book, it grabs you. You get so into it that every time you put it down, all you can think about is the book. This was also one of those books that your sad when it ends because you want to read more of it. Good thing there is 2 more! This is a must read for all fantasy and science fiction readers!
__label__2 Good CD dictionary that can be better: This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound.
__label__1 No support for low screen res: The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words.
__label__2 Excellent Dictionary: I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language, I love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words. I hoped if the book isn't so big and heavy but I guess it's impossible for this dictonary. I like to recommend to evrybody and I have so. For new buyers, you won't regret. People might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but THIS is quiet an extraordinary...
__label__1 not the worse film or acting...: but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz, but... anyway, i watched it to the end, i guess mostly because it was based on a true story.
__label__2 Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. It is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs. She ends out having her husband murdered and then... Overall it made me think.I thought it was well acted particularly by Kidman. The film was well filmed.Worth seeing.
__label__1 A Train Wreck: This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy, it fails to deliver any satirical bite whatsoever. Suzanne Stone's frequent video segments where she speaks directly to the camera and the flashforwards to some sort of Jerry Springer-like show are painful to watch. Yeah, Nicole Kidman is extremely sexy (duh), but it's not nearly enough to overcome her marginal acting, the clumsy dialog and the amateurish direction.See this movie for all the humor of "Dying Young" coupled with the social commentary of a SpongeBob episode.
__label__1 0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied: This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan, despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box. It is 1.33:1 format and even says at the beginning of the film: "This film has been modified from its original format-It has been formatted to fit this screen." If you got stung, demand a refund. What nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format?
__label__1 What a pity: Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
__label__2 Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR"S EDGE" in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend.
__label__1 A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works.
__label__1 Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat.
__label__2 A great work of art: This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience.
__label__2 exquisite: how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
__label__1 Long Winded, Sand and Stars: There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious.
__label__1 WHY???: I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on.............
__label__1 Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift: I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well, the case I received was rusted. yes, a brand new case, out of the box, had rust on the handle and the closure buckles. I returned it.
__label__1 Must be made in China: I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it, she informed me that the set already began falling apart. The hinge came off and it's literally falling apart on her.This was embarrassing because it was a gift from me. Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk.
__label__1 Cute But Poor Quality: These are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Granted, we live in a cold climate, so our house is usually cool, but one ought not have to drink a cup of espresso in 3 minutes before it cools off. Also the cup itself gets quite hot if one happens to touch it while using the handle. Best to give to your daughter for a toy.
__label__2 This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves.
__label__1 Re-Releasing "An Evening With John Denver" under a different title!: If you already own "An Evening with John Denver" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! "Boy From The Country" and "Today"...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?
__label__2 Bang Bang Kiss Kiss: This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw. But this is just the tip of the ice berg. Demos go way back to Impossible Shot, Don Fury and Monster Zero. If you want to hear an even earlier inception of GlassJAw be sure to check out Sons of Abraham's album "Termites in His Smile" which is Jewish Hardcore. KKBB was ORIGINALLY released before EYEWTKAS so it has a different sound. But like every release glassjaw has put out, each one sounds different from the previous. Everyone into glassjaw should get this album, although the price listed on here is redic!! one should check out merchdirect.
__label__1 No idea about this album: I ordered this album, but it never came. Beware of third party sellers, because they can be shifty. I certainly wish I could give you a review of this album, but unfortunately I NEVER GOT IT!!
__label__2 prattgirl: I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again.
__label__2 Letters of the Past: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through.
__label__2 Great Story, Patterson Does It Again: Sam's Letters to Jennifer is one of those stories where you laugh, you cry, you make a fool of yourself. Jennifer is probably one of Patterson's most likable characters. Even though, there were times when the book kind of reminded me of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (very few), I was pleasantly suprised. It has a very happy and at the same time very heartbreaking ending. Their is a great mystery and it keeps you guessing until the very end. All in all it is very vintage Patterson. Fast paced and great story.
__label__1 YUCK!: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every 1-star reviewer of this book is right on, so I won't repeat their critiques. Every 4- and 5-star reviewer must have read a different book! I am angry that Mr. Patterson holds his loyal fans in such low esteem that he'd allow so shallow and boring a book to come to market. I am angry that his publisher was so greedy to do it! Like so many other bestselling authors, Patterson seems to have lost his touch, even in his mystery series. A smart author should know when to say when, and if he doesn't, then I do - WHEN! If he continues to write this kind of garbage, I will no longer read it.
__label__1 Pathetic Dialogue: I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
__label__1 This is Og Mandino at his worst: This is a fast read, which continues to remind us that we should appreciate each day and those around us. Yes we should but I don't understand why Mr. Patterson wants to venture out of the genre that he excels in...mystery novels.
__label__1 absolute treacle: It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer, who miscarried her dead husband's child, has to deal with her beloved grandmother having a stroke. She meets someone who could be "the one" for her, but -- oops! -- he has a brain tumor and is likely to die. The writing is amateurish, full of telling instead of showing. The only reason I finished it was because I was trapped on vacation in a cabin with nothing else to read.
__label__1 Majorly sucked: This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary, this novel was probably more like 150 real pages long. It also seemed to be written for, oh, I don't know - a ten year old maybe. The writing seemed to be geared to a fourth grade level. All I can hope for now is that it doesn't get made into a load-of-crap TV movie.
__label__1 Just like Suzanne's Diary...: I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story.
__label__1 Tear Up the Formula: I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of "what will make women cry" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story.
__label__1 Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a 14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one.
__label__1 NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too.
__label__2 The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need: This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
__label__1 disappointing: I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
__label__1 Complete waste of time: I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
__label__2 show the entire movie: Currently, the movie start with Barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard. However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,
__label__1 really BAD Sony transfer.: Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful.
__label__1 Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is "Night of the Living Dead"...The 1968, black/white, low budget version. I started watching the 1990 version 'Sci-Fi' one afternoon, and I didn't stop watching it until it was over...Why? It was hilarious...Plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards, and I didn't have anything else to do until then... This movie is despicable compared to the original. From terrible dialogue to terrible themes, this movie is just TERRIBLE... If you haven't seen the 1968 version, with all enthusiasm from myself, please watch it a.s.a.p., but never subject yourself to the remake unless you're either punishing yourself, or you need a good laugh...
__label__1 Garbage: Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
__label__1 Not for everyone: If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others.
__label__2 Sweet and funny, though completely predictable: This movie is not going to shock you with it's ending or offer you a new twist on the same old romcoms of the past. It is a quintessential romcom, but it's so very worth your time. It's very funny; I like all the actors in it, and it's just a fun, light-hearted movie.
__label__2 Adorable Fun Movie, Great Cast!: Love this film. It's a classic. Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman are fantastic! Greg Kinnear is also great in this film., love it, love it!
__label__2 Sweet Little Movie: I know that this movie got "mixed reviews," whatever that means, but I found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts. I enjoyed the DVD for all the extras, too. I loved listening to Hugh Jackman with a different accent than his native Australian, and the oh so proper English accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in."Someone. . ." touches on so many emotions, and Ashley Judd is funny and manic, and her comic timing is great. I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous.
__label__2 Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?
__label__1 Not the best....: The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
__label__2 For light comic romantic entertainment, it's a winner...: Michael J. Fox, David Ogden Stiers, Woody Harrelson and all the supporting cast members are wonderful in this small, quiet story of a stranded doctor in a seemingly stagnant southern town. It's not a masterpiece, not an award winner, not an enduring example of its genre, but it is fun, and it is sweet, and it offers a nice escape from the troubles of the day. For decent folks, it's a very decent 90-minutes of movie magic.
__label__1 Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version.
__label__1 duped: I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least, that was the picture of the dvd that was on the website. What I got was a Korean version. I got my money back.
__label__2 Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection): Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again.
__label__1 no extra features!: I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of, storyboard,production notes or any extra features ! The only extra feature you get with this DVD is the trailer! Oh, did I mention that the DVD has beautiful picture on it! Rent it first ,then buy at Disney outragous price that they want for this DVD! Just watch later on Disney will reissue it (and the others in their collection with all the extras this DVD lack! If you want those extra features stick with the studios Disney owns! They are Miramax,Dimension,Hollywood Pictures,Touchstones Pictures,ABC network,Anchor Bay and Walt Disney Pictures! I hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies!
__label__1 Very Dissapointed: I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
__label__1 Pinocchio not the only one who lies!: This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
__label__2 It's a classic !!: How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again, and watching it in the movie theater. A must buy for any Disney animation fan.
__label__1 This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie, not due to it's "violent and disturbing content" but because of it's bad acting and pure stupidity. This movie is a children's movie, anyone who complains that it's too scary and violent for kids is out of thier minds and are being way too uptight ( people like this are the reason why anime is so butchered when it comes to the States!). But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I'm here to talk about how bad this movie is. It's voice actors aren't that good, the wooden boy has equally wooden acting, and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever! Come on Disney! Explain to me why Pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place?! It was just plain stupid, a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero, when his death makes no sense!
__label__2 Pinocchio 2 Disc Anniversary Edition: This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
__label__2 love it: Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well.
__label__2 BD-live features mostly worthless: I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night, and most of the functions require registration on Disney's site. On Disney's site an FAQ asserts that those features are being discontinued, and account creation is no longer possible. WTH? This disc was only released 8 months ago, and the much-heralded BD-Live features that personalize your disc and experience are already outdated.For what it's worth, I just bought UP (released last week), and the BD-Live features from Disney appear to be nothing but downloading trailers for other films ... four of them. My verdict on Disney BD-Live => total waste of time.
__label__1 Not very good: I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week, they were both leaking dirt. So I went and ordered beed hacky sacks and now I'm happy. Did not like the dirtbags at all.
__label__2 The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you.
__label__2 Love it!!: I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
__label__2 Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith, taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world. His gift / curse enables him to see both past and future events, leading him ever closer to his final destiny. Martin Sheen (The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane) is excellent as the lizard-like senate candidate, Greg Stillson. Horror mistress, Brooke Adams (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Shock Waves, Sometimes They Come Back) is Johnny's could / should-have-been "wife", unable to shake Johnny from her mind. Tom Skerritt (Alien) is the sheriff of Castlerock who seeks out Johnny in order to catch the infamous Castlerock killer. Herbert Lom (Asylum) is Johnny's doctor. Even Anthony Zerbe (The Omega Man) and Colleen Dewhurst (When A Stranger Calls) are along for this wild ride! Highly recommended...
__label__2 Good movie: Not much to say. Good story, Christopher Walken is awesome, great ending, not too much gore.Four more words are required...
__label__2 Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society.: Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book, try Go West Old Man by Max Barnet, a true tale about a father/son trip across the country in a pickup truck, discovering each other, including their needs. A clash of generations resolving.
__label__1 Predictable: The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it, instead of stories of angry, sad boys.
__label__2 The classic analysis on the internal life of boys: I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but, nonetheless, is worth buying.
__label__2 A Family Comedy That Is Out Of This World.: Suburban Commando is a 1991 sci-fi action/comedy family film which stars WWE Legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Christopher Lloyd and Shelley Duvall. In this film Hogan portrays Shep Ramsey, a gruff and cynical intergalatic bounty hunter who, after a botched rescue mission, travels to Earth for rest and relaxation. There, Ramsey begrudgingly makes friends with a couple(Lloyd and Duvall)and their two kids. While on Earth, Shep comically learning the Earth cultures and customs. Suburban Commando also has an appearance by WWE wresling star The Undertaker, as one of Ramsey's arch-villains. The special feature includes a trailer of the movie and trailers for New Line's other family films. This film is perfect for kids, parents and wrestling fans of all ages.
__label__2 Great Flick!: Loved it in the 80's, story and humor sill holds up! Kevin Bacon young and energetic. Great fun!Spawned sequels which don't hold a candle to this original.
__label__2 funny and a little scary: We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
__label__2 Good Entetainment: Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which, incidentally, is never used.
__label__2 Awesome Picture!!!: Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the "Picture Quality" on the "Tremors" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome.
__label__2 Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art, but by gum, it's cracking good fun. The comedy is suitably black and nasty, the tension is very palpable, and the concept - well, the concept may not be absolutely original (what is, these days?) but it is very good. I think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be, ironic, intelligent, sassy, smart and well-acted. The monsters are JUST this side of credible, which makes it all the more riveting. Last night, I was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie - and had to keep reminding myself that it was JUST a movie. That is the sign of a successful "beast" horror movie. It relies upon common sense, a humourous screenplay, actors who do not ham any more than is necessary, and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun. Brilliant stuff.
__label__1 Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars: This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original, the acting is horrific, the swordfighting utterly ridiculous.The scene that sums it all up is when the guards won't chase after a carriage going about 1 mph and everyone escapes.I have no idea how on earth anyone could make a movie so terrible. Extremely torturous to watch. Do not buy it, do not rent it. In fact, just read the book, which is awesome.
__label__1 Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD.
__label__1 Received a used set: Nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but the manufacturer's original box had been opened before and rather clumsily taped back together, and the "aluminum" case is covered in small scratches and dents. I don't have the time to return the set for replacement since it was bought as a gift for an upcoming occasion. Disappointing.
__label__1 A disappointment!: Having made the change to Veganism recently, and discovering Seitan, I was expecting this cookbook to open the door to non-meat Paradise! The description of the book, and the reviews of others made it sound like the Holy Grail.Bah.I'd say 40-50% of the recipes using the prepared Seitan call for the "wheat-meat" to be battered and deep fried. So WHERE is the healthy cooking in THAT? I was looking for recipes for the actual Seitan preparation, using different seasonings and flavors, and then hoping to find a fake meatloaf recipe, or a fake turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving.I'm still looking.
__label__2 Seitan Quickly: Cookbook on Cooking with Seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly. The book itself wasn't all I had hoped--too many weird ingredients that I can't begin to find--but that is NOT the fault of Amazon or the bookseller who sent the order.
__label__1 Damaged goods: While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift, one arrived broken. When I called customer service to replace the broken glass I was notified that Amazon would not replace the damaged item. I could get a full refund, but they would not send a replacement. I was appalled. What business refuses to replace damaged items? You can guarantee I won't be buying anything being shipped through Amazon anymore. I will buy directly from the seller.
__label__1 Screens wore out quickly: The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
__label__1 Very disappointed: This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest, I've not read it all. I've read the introductory chapter and picked at the rest of the book.I'm disappointed that other reviewers suggest that this book is well written and academic. It's a rambling incoherent mess of ideas that proposes large-scale state censorship/'perception control' and as such has no place in universities which should protect the ideals of academic freedom and free speech. The net is not considered as a political forum, rather there is a heavy authoritarianism.I'm very disappointed with it.
__label__1 Not her best: I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book, in fact most of all the characters are so flawed and dark I hate to consider it a romance. Definately put this on your "if there is nothing else to read" list.
__label__1 insipid: this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
__label__2 A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent.
__label__1 Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...: I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected, the dog came and ate all of the carrots. I expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their Uranium nature, but he loved it! He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen. They were 2' long and a vibrant orange that I have never seen before.
__label__1 Do not buy...: Bought this for a weather experiment. Could only produce 1.19 gigawatts, had to seek out another source that was very unpleasant to work with.
__label__2 Excellent Fuel for Robot Army: As a busy mad scientist with many voices distracting me on a nearly constant basis, it is helpful to find such a wonderful product that I can use on on a daily basis. Whether as fuel for my robot army (coming soon to a neighborhood near you) or as a catalyst for mutation or just as a healthy snack, this product continues to amaze. My wife/captive swears by it and uses a pinch in her morning coffee. She is literally glowing from the inside out because this product. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Need a lawyer or an act of Congress !!!!: After the 200 jars of your uranium ore arrived at my home. A heavily armed S.W.A.T team tossed in a few tear gas canisters and broke down my front door. Thankfully, they have WIFI here at Guantanamo. I hear my wife will be getting out of the hospital soon and my kitty kat will be fetching tear gas canisters in heaven now. All of my new friends don't speak a word of english but the weather is nice here. Thanks Amazon.com and thank you Department of Homeland Security!
__label__2 Thank you Jewish Physics: My son is only 6'2 and if he wishes to be an NFL QB, well then, mutation is the best possible avenue now that human growth hormone is banned. I put this stuff on his cereal in the AM and now after a month he stands at 8'1. Can you say signing bonus?
__label__1 Can of cancer: I got some of this stuff to cover myself with during Halloween. I thought it would be cool to walk around glow in the dark.Instead the day before Christmas I got diagnosed for cancer of everything and I've got [...] less for chemotherapy treatments (great, more radiation) since I can't return this can of death.On a happy note, my wife just found out she was pregnant. I hope our kid doesn't have two heads and ten arms. Well, if the baby does maybe we can send it to India where it will be worshiped as a god.
__label__1 NOT ENOUGH!: It did little more than power a death star, so I returned it to the Earth forces... DO NOT BUY!
__label__1 WARNING: DO NOT EAT: Oratory ingestion is not recommended. I decided to eat some of my Uranium last week and experienced some unwanted side-effects. I now go by the name General Zorg AND YOU SHALL BOW DOWN TO ME AND MY MUTANT POWERS!!!
__label__2 Do Not own yet, but will in near future...: I am waiting for my full body hazmat protection suit to come in the mail. Afterwards I will order this unit. Great price!
__label__2 I like it. I love it! I want some more of it!!: Yeah, give it to me, baby. Give me some more! What a tasty little movie!Now, let me be serious. This movie is delicious! Gibson and Hunt are both terrific. Have you seen Braveheart? Well, that movie is only good because of Mel Gibson. What Women Want is good and funny for the same reason. Maybe Helen Hunt had a little to do with that, but Gibson alone is sufficient for a movie's goodness and funniness. Basically, Gibson and hunt made this movie work; the screenwriter and director and everyone other than Gibson and Hunt had nothing to do with it.
__label__1 Distaff.: Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed! He's a Don Juan in the advertising world, who gets zapped by his blow-dryer while drinking some interesting-looking Cabernet. The result? He's given the ability to read women's thoughts. This is distressing, at first. Regressive, too: according to the writers (all women), these Turn-Of-The-Millennium-I'm-Every-Woman women primarily want to feast their eyes on Mel's tooshy. Hear me ROAR! Well, our hero soon learns to use his newfound Superpowers for his own profit, but then . . . ah, but then, the movie suddenly gets very serious. Most of the second act is dull. The movie finally wears out its welcome starting with about the last 15 minutes. Rent only if you want to annoy your boyfriend . . . which is REALLY What Women Want! (Kidding, kidding -- sheesh)
__label__1 *GAG* - Not another sugar-coated chick flick!!: This movie proves that Hell is full and the dead are walking the Earth, making these movies and sitting in theatres watching them. The old "all men are scum until they get in touch with their feelings" plot is dredged up again in this lamebrain film. I guess I was supposed to get all doe-eyed and say "Is'nt Mel dreamy?" and laugh at the supposed "Comedy" while watching this flick, but it made me wretch! Boring, silly and a waste of time.What do men want? Our money back!
__label__1 predictable: predictable hollywood flick. not horrible if you've just eaten too much, it's 1 in the morning, and you need something to zone out with. aside from that scenario, not worth the time.
__label__1 I hope not.: Rather pretentious comedy featuring Mel Gibson, who, despite all the emasculation, is in bumpy, toothy, silly-little-boy mode. What women want, indeed!

__label__2 EXCELLENT: This Cd of Daft Punk is unbelievable. If you wanna hear rythmic sounds without profanity, threats or abuse of women, excellent tunes, great dance or work out music.
__label__2 good overall toy: this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast, but it has great range and it's batteries last a long time. the only problem with the battery system is that it takes 6 AA batteries and u keep having to get new ones. I also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat doesn't tip. Overall, this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children.
__label__1 There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about "breaking with reality", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what "facts" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think "not keeping guns in the house" and "not letting your child butcher pets" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D. Besides if you get rid of D&D who will you blame when they finally do kill someone?
__label__2 Wow!: We had heard about this item (and the many similar items) and decideded that we'd give it a try. Wow! We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent, but we don't think that would matter under the circumstances - we weren't either.
__label__2 Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
__label__2 Excellent edition of the book: This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (kindle): All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!
__label__2 This is the Muhammad Ali of books, The Greatest of all time.: Dumas is the greatest story teller ever, and this is his finest work. If you love adventure, great yarns or being captivated by excellence, read this book.
__label__2 Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version.
__label__2 Kinda wish I had read the longer one!: This is BY FAR, the best book I have EVER read! I HATE reading, and I read this 450 page book in three days! It was for summer reading for school, and I thought that I would read it before i saw the movie coming out soon! I AM SO GLAD I DID!! Thanks!
__label__1 Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly, I read this book by personal selection and not by a Literature assignment. I remember it as the first book I loved. I am a voracious reader of reviews on Amazon and other sources. A recent review of this book reminded me that I should read it again. I'm enjoying it as much now as I did then.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes.
__label__2 The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
__label__2 Superb, but definitely a product of its time: Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read.
__label__1 Terrible, terrible edition: A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there.
__label__2 Excellent: Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that.
__label__1 Abridged version, buyer beware.: This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion.
__label__1 Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
__label__2 Great story of redemption: Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed.
__label__1 Thumbs down: The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
__label__2 breath of fresh air: For the Love of Children, is filled with wonderful stories and quotes that will let any parent at any phase of parenting know that they are not alone.It is delightful to hear other people give voice to my parenting challenges, such as Robert Frost's statement about a father and mother toward son and daughter. One of the best quotes, "If you don't want your children to hear what you're saying, . . . . pg 27
__label__2 This book would make a great Mother's day gift!: This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer, I have used the quotes in articles and letters. A perfect addition to your library if you write to or about children.
__label__2 Highly recommended baby doll!: This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect "play Mommy" doll. She appears very well made and durable.
__label__2 This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that. It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story. If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well.
__label__2 IT WAS THE BEST!!!: IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
__label__1 Ordered for Christmas but...: Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
__label__2 One of the best movies ever made!!: This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story, dancing and music is unbelievable!! I think everyone should see this at least once in their life!!
__label__2 I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!: I always thought this was a lame movie, but I really love it now that I've seen it. Yes, it IS a chick-flick, so if you don't like those types of movies, don't buy it.
__label__2 I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby, when she is teaching him the cha-cha! I definatly recommend this movie to everybody. A time-less classic!
__label__2 sexy/thoughtful: this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need "brothas" out there that still think like you.
__label__2 8701-Usher!: This cd is HOT ... I love it. One of my favorite Usher cds ever! Has several hits... One of his best ever! Must have for the fan of Usher! I am happy to have it for my own collection! Its great from start to finish!
__label__2 LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!: Usher's "8701" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them "I love you". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are "U remind me", "U got it bad", "Twork it out", "Can u help me", "If I want to", "Good ol' Ghetto" and "TTP" (lol, basically every track on the album!). On a last note....those of you who know what good R&B music is, this album is a must, TRUST ME!!!
__label__1 who would have thought..: that this cute little guy by the name of Usher who came out with the awesome "My Way" would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as Britney Spears. Grow up Usher. Be a man. You either have the talent/personality/ and originality or you don't. Leave r & b and go be one of Brit's back up dancers.
__label__2 2nd BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!: Second to NSYNC'S, "Celebrity", this CD is my favorite of all time! When you want to listen to 13 of 15 songs on a CD, you know it's good! This CD has an amazing balance of ballads and fast trax and rap. And the ballads are INCREDIBLE! "U Got It Bad" is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. I would DEFINITELY recommend that anyone a fan of Pop, R&B or Rap to get this CD, YOU WILL LOVE IT!
__label__2 usher was creative then: now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
__label__1 Don't Bother: A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
__label__1 ewan mcgregor's hot: although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly, ewan co-produced it! <i don't why he would ever sign to be co-producer of THAT film..it should have been moulin rouge!> So back to the movie..I hated Susan Lynch in this film. has she ever heard of shaving? I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!
__label__2 Riveting Reading!: Fast paced, I could hardly put it down. It left me wanting more. I,will recommend this book to family and friends
__label__1 good for a b-day prsent?: my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
__label__1 TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.: C'mon people! How fun is it to watch a racist, lewd, borrish, and dumb person beating up people for no f-----g reason. As little as possible. All the film does is show two unorthadox sleep in car all night, hold up bars just because there are black people there, and reapeatedly getting the same food as 24 minutes ago. And a point that should go out, THERE IS NO CAR CHASE! Just someone chasing a train! I will end by saying that this trashy film deserved no oscars! BYE!
__label__2 Fast moving police drama: This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character ("Popeye" Doyle).This is good police drama and quite entertaining.
__label__2 Timeless, Greyish and Well Structured Police Story: There is a scene at the beginning of this classic movie wherein everyone seems to be having a great time in a bar when from nowhere a sort of stop-time moment occurs when dectective Popeye eyeing some locals knows for dead-center certainty something major is wrong. From there it is only a matter of piecing together (like the ubiquous and sinsiter car) the plot. This gritty, seemingly greyish and astonishingly well-edited movie offers a powerful glimpse into the mechanisms and travails of international corruption
__label__2 THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!: French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole, a N.Y. Narcotics Cop who is investigating the recent flow of herion coming into N.Y. He and his partner (Roy Shrieder) get into the absorbing process of phone tapping, following suspects, and stakeouts. A real good crime movie from director William Friedkin. One of the best films ever made, also has the most exciting chase scene in history. A winner!!
__label__2 THE FRENCH CONNECTION: DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!
__label__1 inadequate disclosure: Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
__label__1 Low quality sound: The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
__label__2 THE REAL PLAYAS: TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
__label__2 GREAT resource!: I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
__label__2 AWESOME!: Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
__label__2 Crystal Growing Science Kit: This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl.
__label__1 I never thought Meryl Streep could give a "bad" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh, well, I guess one stinker in an otherwise glorious career is to be forgiven. Don't watch unless you are a "movie masochist."
__label__1 Okay !!!!: This movie was okay, it wasn't a 10 more like a 3..... I could have gone without buying this foolishness
__label__1 Too drawn out!: I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
__label__2 Hilarious: This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended, but you need to make sure you see the first movie before this one. :)I'd stop after this one though, Tremors 3 was pretty bad.
__label__1 Not quite...: Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments, but just doesn't hook the viewer like the original. A key ingredient missing in this movie is Kevin Bacon. If you haven't seen the first Tremors, I would strongly recommend NOT viewing the sequel. However, if you enjoyed the first one, the sequel may be worth your time.
__label__1 Worthless!: They peeled off within a week. I cleaned the tub; wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface. I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well, but to no avail.
__label__1 I really don't recommend this product.: Purchased this a while back, and was disappointed from the moment I opened the box. The construction was flimsy and the mic didn't even work. All this thing did was waste time and money.
__label__1 drying and sticky: I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
__label__2 This book is possibly the best I've ever read.: This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages, I was reading it every free second I got. I can guarantee that anyone will love this book.
__label__1 A story as lush as the planet it is set on!: Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books "House Atreides" and " 'Harkonen" confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most.
__label__1 A Great Book, Horrible Price: I had this book. I've read it twice. When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake. Set a reasonable price for this book, and I'd happily purchase it!
__label__1 predictable: After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
__label__1 It;s just not very good: I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune, but a true mediocrity in its own right, with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just don't make any sense. The point of Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, is to enjoy the much grand God-Emperor of Dune.
__label__2 You won't regret: Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet, this must be first thing you have to read.
__label__2 Brief, but to the point: This book is very brief, but I guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems Frank Herbert wanted it to be a link between Dune before Paul, and the Dune after Paul. The end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage, the children of Muadib.
__label__2 The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more "real" than most people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out of the water. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You will NOT regret it.
__label__2 The best book I ever read: Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you, but it is the only thing I can say. Read it.
__label__1 Great writing - poor publishing: ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print & editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous, resulting in many blots & light print areas...print pressure is inconstant, resulting in wavy print & apparent font reduction...then there are the editorial errorspg. 108 "the gift is the blessing of the river" <giver>...the most egregious so farif there had been physical defect allowing return to place of purchase, this paperback would surely have been exchanged for a previously published edition of better quality
__label__1 Do yourself a favor and don't open it!: I rather liked "Dune" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series, don't bother.
__label__1 Sorry, but I really didn't like it very much: I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books.
__label__2 Read the Series: I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two, three and four-hour) versions of the movie. The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed.
__label__2 DUNE ...Best Science Fiction Book I have ever read!: Of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it's the truth! I picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report... (yeah i don't read muchy for my enjoyment) but anyway i read it and now i want more. This book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing Dune Messaih and Children of Dune and can't wait to read them. Dune changed my outlook on reading with it's indept look at politics, treachery and the way these two twist together in the Dune. I love it.
__label__2 A Lifetime Favorite: I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give.
__label__1 Kindle version: I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn't, mis-spellings of stillsuit as "stulsuit"....Please, buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you'd think with it being on the computer it'd be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune.
__label__1 Embarrassing Ebook: After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title.
__label__2 DUNE is the book for our time: I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie, but the movie went well with the book. It put a face to the all the characters that I was so fascinated with. DUNE should be a book that should be read in high school, and studied. There is a message for those who read the book and those who are die hard fans of Frank Herbert will understand and relate it to present day....
__label__1 What was the point of this book again?: This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done, but other than that I cannot find anything at all good about this book. The first half of the book is completely pointless, unlike the first book we don't need to know about the characters because they are basically the same. The only reason I finished this book was to read the next book.
__label__2 No doubt about it!: One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice, however, is to skip Dune Messiah and go right to Children of Dune. The second book isn't nearly as good as the first; the third is even better. Herbert's writing improved with age, and God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune will blow you away even if you just sort-of like the original Dune.
__label__2 Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
__label__2 Interesting continuation.: Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah.
__label__2 just a few steps to total enlightenment: 1. Read the book during the summer-time2. Download the song "Final Dream" from the 80s movie "Dune"3. Immerse yourself in water and/or listen to the song.4. Break out in tears.This book will change your life forever. :)
__label__2 Dune: Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one,Paul Mau'dib a man that was given to the fremen as there saviour. He was the chosen one, the only male that could stand to the poisonious juice that only the benajesuits have the power as women to resist the power of the jui ce in order to become one of there own. As the story went on thw character of mau'dib feel in tot he world of the fremen and wanted to help them out of there fight for freedom . He was the only one that could do it for them. If he didn't do it he would just be wasting his talent. His talent to control the world in his fingers. He do it all he had the people afraid of what he could do , and it was all over one little insignifacant thing. He now controls the spice and will for a long time never be harmed.
__label__2 Just the Best: Honestly, this book is one of the best I have ever read.(I have read a lot of books). Its plot, characterization and flawless storytelling make for one compelling read.
__label__2 Not the best book ever, but it is up there.: This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.
__label__1 An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: "it was kinda boring." If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters.
__label__2 Warm and self sacrificing: Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
__label__1 Horribly Disappointing: First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out.
__label__2 Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works, this story is sure to please. Anne Hathaway is stunning and believable as Jane Austin. James McAvoy portrays young Jane's love interest and their chemistry is fantastic. Romantic, witty, Sad, funny, passionate - all things that make a great "chick" flick. You'll wish it wouldn't end. One word to the wise - Don't subject your husbands / boyfriends to this movie or you'll never hear the end of it.
__label__2 GREAT MOVIE: Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
__label__1 Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no "Mrs. Brown." It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless.
__label__2 one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read, and i have read all of them. It is short,concsice and to the point.Tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points. A one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space.
__label__2 Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play, and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!
__label__2 My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre, but we rented it last year on video and really enjoyed it. Surprisingly, however, my 5-year-old son was wild about it! I had heard it was too scary for young kids, but he loved it. In fact, it has become one of his all time favorite movies, and we have rented it so many times (at his request) that we're going to buy the video for him for Christmas. The special effects in this movie are great, and (unlike the professional reviewers), I think the character development is fine. I think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun!
__label__2 Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.
__label__2 Day-Timer stand: I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it, with this stand I can leave it at the corner of my desk and view it at an easy angle to see without ever having to pick it up. It is sturdy enough to write on and has storage space below for stationary & letterhead. My only complaint is the high price, I would have bought a different brand if I could have found the same thing cheaper.
__label__1 So where's the rest of it????: I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending.
__label__1 a sorry bit of commercialism: I should have known better after the "Rose Red" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire.
__label__2 Great toy! Great service!: I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
__label__1 Fuel Pump: Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly,,, I was Extremely Disappointed that the Carter pump that was sent to me, looked NOTHING like the pump in the picture (instead, it was the newer style, bolt-together type),, and when you're trying to restore an old Mustang and the pump is suppose to appear a certain way (like in the advertised picture), that's what you expect to receive. It's all about the details!Doug S.
__label__1 Plays but is noisy: This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards, goes to slow. Awkward to use. Worst CD player I have ever owned. Don't buy it, you'll be sorry.
__label__1 This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted: I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the "Facts" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read "Unfit for Command". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much.
__label__1 Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam: The book has no information on Kerry's "tour of duty" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the "new" Vietnam.
__label__1 Not a hero.: Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and "out" while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
__label__1 Campaign for Kerry: To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't.
__label__1 Waste of time and money: This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it.
__label__1 Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias: The following disclaimer appears on the "Unfit for Command" Swift boat book:"Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!"Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under "Tour of Duty" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!
__label__2 Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts. I have been a lifelong democrat...ok a liberal democrat. I alwaysjust assume that all of these guys are just Rush Limbaugh clones, allsinging from his hymnal. A friend of mine convinced me to read this book andI must admit...I have started to re-think some of my views. This guy stateshis opinion & gives you the FACTS to back it up...it's hard to dispute whathe says. I'm still a democrat (notice I left the "d" lower case), but nolonger consider myself a liberal...I can't believe it myself...READ THISBOOK!
__label__2 what a world: A friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I have to admit it was way beyond anything I ever imagined. I have practically worn the CD out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music. Being a sax player myself, I was especially inspired by how fat the sounds of the saxaphones are......absolutely incredible!
__label__2 Chilling!: I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved "The Night" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of "Morphine's" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply "Chilling". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: "Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?" Thank you Mark...for the beauty.
__label__1 Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!
__label__1 Misleading information: I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading ("GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver." An initialism is hardly "slang") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to "save batteries." Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car, why not just carry spare batteries?).It appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching. Take his advice with a grain of salt.
__label__2 A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying, "Dickie! Where's my Dickie?!" I bought it for sentimental reasons. It's a really great movie, if only for all the stars that appear. It's also got Truman Capote, who is strange and wonderful. It's got lots of twists and turn. The introduction is a little long - the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion. It's a little gimicky, but it's Neil Simon, so that's to be expected. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Was I a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as I remember it? Sure. The last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is. It's got some good extras, but not as many as I generally like. But it's a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances.
__label__2 This is one funny movie!!: This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie "Clue" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!
__label__2 personal top #10: If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
__label__2 Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out, and remember all the crazy stuff that went on. Later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it, waiting for certain parts. It draws on a great cast, a strange script, and sets that fit the storys mood. Its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors, and hire a top notch screenplay writer. Its easier now to just get one known actor, or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it. I enjoy that type of movie too, but this is not like that. This is a fun movie, thats the best way to describe it.
__label__1 Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that.
__label__1 <*** This movie is BAD! ****>: I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions, and big stunts are the only dosis you'll be getting, because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance!...unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting.Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, I wish Hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity.Please don't allow this to continue, bad movies must be stopped once and for all.Rent this movie if it makes you happy but don't be another victim, or worst yet another supporter of this movie.
__label__1 Top 10 reasons you saw "XXX": 10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class "Bad Movies 101". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act.
__label__2 Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!: There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound, this whole movie genre isn't it. If your looking for fast paced action, witty dialogue, an edgy sound track that compliments the plot... a wild, unique approach to stunts, and a totally unconventional, irreverent "secret agent"... then this movie is for you.Vin Diesel makes a very entertaining, believable Xander Cage, but give him a break...this isn't a Shakespeare movie! It's a spy movie and does follow the genre rules, but not enough to make it like any other. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride!
__label__1 Mindless, Pointless and Insulting: Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is "cute" and people who liked "Fast & The Furious" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like "Far From Heaven" or "The Hours" or even "Minority Report"? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this.
__label__1 head for the XXX-it: I've only ever walked out of one movie, and this was it. I actually stayed for an hour, hoping it'd get better...but it actually got worse. The acting: bad, the stunts: bad, the plot: VERY bad. I wouldn't wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies (even thogh I have none). Save your money, send it to Sally Struthers or something.
__label__1 Unleaded: Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean, he did show some promise in far superior films like Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan but enough already.
__label__1 Triple Bad!!!: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the "new James Bond" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!
__label__1 HORRIBLE!!!!!!: Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY..
__label__2 Good introductory real options book for beginner or manager: It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options, binomial pricing and Black-Scholes model where the last ten chapters or so are case studies dedicated to applications of real options where it gives readers an idea how real options can be applied in diverse industries.It makes a good and easy read for anyone who wants a quick flavor of real options without going through too much of the horrible maths that derivatives and real options seems to have !I personally enjoy reading it from cover to cover.
__label__2 An American Classic: Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job, a bit wordy for me. Just dont have the time to read this style of writing.
__label__2 Captivating: Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice, but for the most part a really good audio book.
__label__1 deplorable: this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs, the color of the street, or smell of the rain. is this really needed? this book could have easily been condensed into one half its size. the author's continuing mention of "The Great Twitch" has no impact on the average person's life. this book is a waste of your time, don't read it!
__label__1 Pointless: This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
__label__2 Extremely unappreciated: This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed.
__label__1 Thou Preachest Too Much!: This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student, this book will confirm what he or she already knows and may add a few additional touches to personal trouble spots. For the average to poor student, it may be hard to get past the school marmish tone to get to "the goods" this book has to offer. I'm afraid in today's environment, this book won't reach those who need it the most.
__label__2 Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!: I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a "well-reasoned", "logically-based", "original", "thought-provoking" review. I simply like what I hear or I don't. But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years. The Rolling Stones is one of them. I picked up the CD simply because it was the Rolling Stones. I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT. They kept to the formula and then spiked it! I'm not going to compare it to past albums, or group line-ups or anything. I cannot tell you if it is better or worse than other albums. This one just stands on it's own! If you do love the Rolling Stones, you will be floored! Let me just tell you that in their golden years, the Stones still had the "stones" to pull it off again. You pick this CD up for the heck of it, and you walk away 100% satisfied that you got your money's worth, and unlike Mick, YOU GET SATISFACTION! What a superb rocker!
__label__2 This is a great album, a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity.: You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with "Some Girls", "Exile on Main Street" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in "Casablanca". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it.
__label__2 say YES to THE STONES: THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
__label__1 the same thing.....: The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries, they are playing to rebels..writting songs about bush etc...Ths is the only way to call the media attention?
__label__1 YUK..............: Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit 1970?
__label__1 What a Bunch of Trash!: I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get, this group of songs some south Philly garage band could have written. What a disgrace for the Stones to put out this Lousy album. I am deeply disturbed buy the fact that people are giving this rave reviews just because it's a Stones album. Be ashamed, Be very ashamed of yourselves for telling people this CD is worth their hard earned cash!
__label__1 Oh, Pleeeze: The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad! If you have a brain, you will cringe. "...i'm just one of your cocks": How old are you guys!? Musically it's pretty rockin and tight. I wish you could turn down Jagger, not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego.
__label__1 This CD reminds me of a not good CD: I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
__label__2 Another winner: Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment, Dead Wrong. I love the Joanna Brady series and will not miss one. Jance has got a real winner here. I like this series far more that the J.P. Beaumont series. Also, there is no need to read the other books in the series before picking up this one. Jance brings everyone up to speed without any confusion if you start a book in the middle of the series. Great characterizations and storyline.
__label__2 TL!: Bought this cd many, many years ago. I can't truthfully name one song from it, but I will vouch for Tracy Lawrence, he's a good singer!!
__label__1 OK, but there's better stuff out there for the money: ....I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD, but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron. Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo, and not imitate a real stereo like this unit, but the support for formats, and features is 400% better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast...
__label__1 Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music.
__label__1 thumbs down: All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie.
__label__2 Improves with age...: I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment, I also wasn't wild about Maria Friedman compared to Laurie Beechman, but I warmed up to her on my second viewing. As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway. If you have a choice, get the DVD because the documentary is worth watching.
__label__2 Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome, still love Donny Osmond and he's excellent in this production.
__label__2 Best Musical of All Time: Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
__label__2 Can't get enough!!!!!: I have seen a few broadway shows in the past, but when I saw Joesph for the first time in Salt Lake City I was blown away. I instantly went out and bought the DVD and every Sunday my family and sit down and watch it togather. The set up with the school kids watching the show in the school auditorium magical and touching. Go Go Donny and I hope to see you in Salt Lake city again.
__label__1 Can we say "overproduced"?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song "Any Dream Will Do" to the BEGINNING of the show.
__label__1 Not for Children: Donny Osmond was wonderful as always, the female lead was not as strong as the CD. This video is not for children. The costumes in the Pharoah's scene are offensive and in poor taste.
__label__2 Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best!: I have wanted to see this musical for the last year, and was overjoyed when I heard that 'Great Performances' would be showing it on April 5th. After a gruling two weeks, the big day came. I watched with unblinking eyes trough the entire show. I thought it was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen on 'Great Performances', apart from 'Cats' of course. If I could give it higher then 5 stars, I would. Though the Mrs. Potiphar's scene I have to admit was a little on the personal side, it didn't really show anything. Her servents costumes were NOT see through, they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread. I would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to. If I could find it on video around my town and if I had the money to buy it, I would.
__label__2 The whole family enjoys it!: I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago, and wondered why I waited so long to see it. I took my older children (then aged 8 & 9) to see it two years later--they loved it, too! They insisted I buy the soundtrack CD (also an awesome thing to have), and now my three year old bops around the house singing, "Go, go, go Joseph!" Good music, great lyrics, a great evening for the entire family! A must for Andrew Lloyd Weber fans of all ages.
__label__2 Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version, just fleshed out a bit. The jail and Potiphar's offices are a new departure, with a triangular theme in black, white and silver. What impressed me the most, though, was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production. The chorus work also seems to have been augmented, with additional harmony lines and dances. All in all, a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium, even in video form! Enjoy!
__label__2 Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD, and this was by far better. The cast has so much fun with their roles that the audience can't help but enjoy the performance. Donnie Osmond was made for this role, and Maria Friedman shines as the Narrator. I saw another review that said this was racy and distasteful for children, but I found it no more inappropriate than the live performance, and the scenes in question are over so fast, children will hardly have time to question it. I think it's great for the whole family, musical-lovers and nonmusical-lovers alike! I expected it to be the taping of a live performance, and was dreading the poor quality that is unavoidable in such cases, like extreme facial closeups, and bad lighting. What a surprise this was! It was nothing like I expected, and better than I hoped!
__label__1 Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace.
__label__2 I really like: the story being told. The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing. The biggest reason I purchased this DVD is the singing.
__label__2 A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far.
__label__1 Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to "do these things like they do" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?
__label__2 Some people...: This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
__label__2 Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. "My Own" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own. Get this if you want to "listen" to a message, not just "hear" words.
__label__1 Stuff is great but don't buy here: Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty, but don't buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can't return food to Amazon. The first few bags were super but bag five, which was still in code, tasted nasty, as did bag six. I didn't open any more and contacted Harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that doesn't make up for the eight yucky ones I'm stuck with.
__label__2 Awesome.... for the year that it was made: Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good movie... What really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story. TCM#1 was the best out of all of them. #4 was the Lamest of all of them...but opinions vary.
__label__1 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However, I was not able to watch the movie for almost a month later due to our remodling of our living room witch houses our surround sound and tv. The blu-ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago, but I was fine with that since I did not own the dvd. The movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen. To my great excitement came sadness when I wanted to see the special features and they did not work!!!!! I cliked on them over and over and nothing, it just brought me back to the main screen again and again. I don't know if this has happened to anybody else, or is my copy a dud.
__label__2 THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.
__label__2 THE SAW IS FAMILY.: I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
__label__1 Widescreen yes, anamorphic, No.: This is great if you have a 27 inch 4:3 Cathode Ray TV but if you have a 16:9 HDTV, beware, it will look terrible.Yes, the "supervised by Tobe Hooper" picture is great, on a small screen but the DVD is in 4:3 Letterbox not 16:9 Anamorphic so you have to "zoom" it to watch on an HDTV and it will look terrible. It's like putting in an old VHS cassette, one that's really deteriorated.I am waiting, anxiously, for a real widescreen version for the modern HDTV audience.
__label__2 so scary: im young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film.
__label__2 Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days, but I caught up with it on video in the 80s. I was so primed to be scared that I watched it on a sunny Saturday afternoon with all the lights on. And it STILL scared the bejesus out of me. You'd be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing Hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you'll leap out of your skin with anxiety. The final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film. It seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you (a) rethink it while you're (b) not sleeping that night.
__label__2 Good, but sometimes disturbing: THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as "Last house on the left". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think "Scream" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a "good" movie. But, if ya think "that" movie contains the same if not "equal" shock value, you need to crawl out of your hole and rent or buy this movie and see what has been stolen{ from such a fine director}.The acting is so amateur that it works in both the comedic range and the serious.The makeup is incredibly real, so that if it had been done in black and white, the film would have been just as effective. And the camerawork, nothing less than brilliant. It's up there with "Psycho" the original [Hitchcock] as well as the remake [Gus Van Sandt] This is real Hideyoureyes terror.Made to be "Watched Alone" in the dark.In the daylight as well.Beware the Meathook
__label__2 The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark masterpiece debut "THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life,i've been a horror movie addict ever since! This film is the ultimate blue-print on how to make a great horror movie. There are many films that contain much more blood & gore then T.C.M. & to the eye of the beholder there may even be films out there that are more scary then T.C.M.(maybe!?!?) but what makes this film numero uno of all horror films is simpley the amount of influence it has contributed to the horror world & its this reason & this reason alone that "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" is the best there was,the best there is & the best there ever will be!
__label__1 DUMB DUMB AND DUMB: this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed
__label__1 Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member.
__label__1 Despite great acting by De Niro, this movie sucks.: Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!
__label__1 All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store, and I got excited. I saw huge names (Keitel, De Niro, Scorsese, what would YOU expect?) So I got home, called a couple of friends over, and we sat and watched this movie.This was possibly the most disappointing movie of all time. I'm not kidding at all. I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie; there was absolutely no plot. I don't know how all these people are prancing around calling it "one of the greatest hits of the '70s!" No.Keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Keitel, as well as De Niro fan. I was so disappointed with this movie; but the problem was, there was absolutely no plot, and no transition. The actors played their characters well, but there was no room for characters in the movie. It was a huge upset; 'travesty' does not do this movie justice. No plot, no culmination, no action, no transition, no STORY. Period.
__label__2 Top Notch: This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie.
__label__2 Great!: When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im 15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out, but now I watched the whole movie of this and I have to buy the 8 disc box collection. I just special ordered it. This movie was really good. I can't wait to see all the other movies even that one part in Nightmare 6 with Carlos. Maybe this time I don't think it would be as bad, but I think everyone should give this movie a try. Wes Craven is very creative. I've seen his other work like Wishmaster 1-4 and he's done pretty good job. Check this one out!
__label__1 this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies.
__label__1 What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure, I mean after awhile people started calling him Freddy everywhere he went. What else was he gonna do, make Cereal or Laundry Soap commercials? Stick with the original series, this was stupid.
__label__2 "He's Back!": Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman, original creator Wes Craven comes back to bring more fear to Elm Street! But this time, the terror doesn't stop at the screen. This is a movie inside of a movie. Freddy's coming into reality because the movies have ended. I love the return of the original cast members,i love the Freddy character in this movie more than i have since Part 4 because he's actually kind of frigtening again,and i think that the story is well executed. I commend you Wes Craven! But on a sad note, i miss the old Freddy look and i most certainly miss the "what the hell?" reaction i got watching the originals. Reality sort of complicates things. But hey, i like the movie... alot.
__label__2 good: this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic.
__label__2 Queen of Hell: I only saw about a third of this movie, but i thought it rocked. And i think Freddy oughtta get a girl, just not Heather, as that one guy suggested. Anyway, my question is, how can a kid sleepwalk with his eyes open if he's completely aware of what's going on around him? Maybe i'm misintrepreting, but i saw this movie when i was nine, four years ago, and i recall Dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital, and Kreuger grabbing him from the sky. The kid was wide awake, so how the heck did Kreuger do it? I mightta missed something, though. I loved the movie, and i'm gonna work on that whole Bride of Kreuger idea this one guy had. Buh-bye.
__label__2 Re-Discover Your Music Collection!: This is a fantastic product! I am NOT a "technical" guy, so I was a bit apprehensive when I ordered the CD Songwriter. Was I happily surprised! I took it out of the box, read the easy-to-follow directions, plugged it in and---immediately---I was rocking the house with LP's and cassettes I literally hadn't heard in years.The CD player and radio are likewise terrific---simple to use and the sound is great. Burning CD's (use blank CD-R's, not CD-RW's) is also a snap. A Rick Springfield cassette I bought in 1985 sounds brand-new burned onto CD with the Crosley Songwriter. A Dylan Thomas poetry album my mom bought in the 1950s likewise sounds crystal-clear on a newly-burned CD.I am so pleased with this Songwriter, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning! Baby Boomers & Gen-X'ers, treat yourselves to this wonderful machine and rediscover your music collection!
__label__2 National Geographic "Africa" Series: Beautifully photographed. However, if you're interested in Africa from a political and historical standpoint, as I am, this is not really the video series for you.Excellent wildlife and nature footage (just as you'd expect from National Geographic) and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about "urban" vs. "tribal" differences.Overall, well worth watching, but don't look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent.
__label__2 If this CD doesn't perk you up, you're dead: A fun CD from beginning to end. Starts out with the radio hit "Zoot Suit Riot", a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that doesn't sound too serious or too contrived. The lyrics reflect the swing-era roots but contain modern phrases and topics (some a little risque). Very tight execution of the genre, every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era. The lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail. A good CD for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background.
__label__2 Damm Good Swing Cd.: This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones, and Pink Elephant. The band is excellent but they do have a habit of adding extra horns and a piano player don't get me wrong these sound great but it makes me wonder if they would sound as good live. As for the lyrics some may find them offensive but in that case don't buy the cd. My opinion? I thought that the lyrics fitted in well with the songs and the style of music. If you like Neo Swing and bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Royal Crown Revue then this cd is defiantly for you.
__label__1 You call this swing?: Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing, this is something I don't know with a name attached to it. You want some REAL swing try the classics, the real thing, like Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, listen to them! the real thing! This is just a modern excuse for music.
__label__2 This cd will make you want to get up and swing dance.: The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite, Zoot Suit Riot.
__label__2 Zoot Suit Riot is the best song on the album.: This album is pretty good...not as good as I had hoped. Zoot Suit Riot is definitely the greatest song on the album, other ones like "Come Back to Me" are also good. But it doesn't live up to the expectations I had. Overall a good album, but not perfect.
__label__1 Wasn't very impressed, especially after all the hype.: I bought this cd after hearing the title song for the hundreth time on the radio, thinking maybe the whole cd would be as good. Boy, was I wrong. I would return it if Amazon would take an opened cd back!
__label__2 THE best album of 1998. Period.: The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. "Zoot Suit" is the best CD of the year. On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the "masters" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's.
__label__2 oh yeah: with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best, the worst complaint ive heard is that you got to know a little about the 30's to get the lyrics, mista-s
__label__1 Awful stuff: I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
__label__1 Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix: These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are.
__label__1 There's much better modern swing out there...: The swingin' sounds on this may rock, but the swingin' words on Zoot Suit Riot are simply awful. Abuse and swing just don't go together... this stuff is supposed to be FUN, not miserable. Go listen to the Squirrel Nut Zippers or Brian Setzer Orchestra instead.
__label__2 Absolutely Love Hoku!: I bought Hoku's CD years ago. I didn't even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD. I am now almost 18, and I still listen to her CD repeatedly. I know every word to every song. I noticed that someone reviewed her song " Another Dumb Blonde" with bad feedback. That person does not know music. Hoku's music is about love and how a girl can overcome a guy. Then she has a song about someone being there for her always, through thick and thin. "You Frist Believed" Is my all-time favorite. Its a touching song and reminded me of someone I know. If I had one last wish before I died, it would be to meet Hoku and her father, Don Ho. She is incredibly beautiful, and very talented. I have done kareoke many times, and most of which I was singing her songs. I am, without a doubt, Hoku's number 1 fan!!!! I love you Hoku!!!!!Amanda
__label__1 Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!: Hoku's ridicousily stupid "Another Dumb Blonde" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde.
__label__1 Another dumb blonde: Although she might say she's not,it's painfully obvious.Hoku is "another dumb blond". The only reason she gets those 5-star reviews is cuz people are so tired of dumb blond singers that they want to believe thet she's different.She danses like a moose.
__label__2 Great CD!: Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge, Kyle Thompson is the only musician ever to record Civil War-era music ON LOCATION at different battlefields. Thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with Lou Gherig's disease by the time of the recording (something I found out after hearing the CD) just made it that much more poignant. The music on the CD is a balanced mix of lighter and darker music. The joy and humor come through in the upbeat songs while the tragedy and sadness of the War comes through the solemn pieces in a way that more glib, nauseously cheery musicians would never be able to communicate.
__label__2 still the best: This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
__label__1 Building the Custom Home Office: This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject. 154 pages dealing with ONE home office layout/concept. AND this is from 2002. Very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch. In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.
__label__2 A cornerstone in brass-band funk: I first got this album in 1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
__label__2 Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok: Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
__label__1 the great queen seondeok: the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
__label__2 Writers, You Need This Book: Whether you are a beginning writer or an established author, this book gives solid advice. I love how you can read the book from cover to cover or just flip to a section that you want to know about right now. Keep it handy and reference it often.Karen Reddick, author of Grammar Done Right!
__label__1 their lesbian schtick is running thin: god, this music is soooo annoying! and didn't Britney already do the schoolgirl thing? they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it.boring.
__label__2 THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna, Stevie Nicks, Michael Jackson. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. I absolutley love each song to pieces.The album is very dark pop/electro, and it's enhoyable from start to finishMy favorite songs are How soon is Now, Stars, 30 minutes, and of course the classic Not Gonna Get Us, and All the Things she Said.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!You have to listen to it! it's phenomenal!!
__label__2 Tatu - Russian Music comes to the USA: Folks,For several years, the Russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent. Tatu is not the best Russian group, but they are pretty good, their music is very catchy. And...if you listen to the Russian versions, they're even more hypnotic.\According to people in Russia, Tatu is a kids band, a little 2nd rate, but what the heck, the songs are great, good melodies...I sing to them! My only problem is I heard them first as Russian songs, now they have been transformed into English!Perhaps someday the USA will be graced by even better artists, like Alsou Safina, someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well.
__label__2 These girls are definetely gonna get you!: Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them, and I was immediately hooked. These girls have amazing voices, and you can definetely tell their heart and souls are in their music. I also think it's awesome that they are open about their sexuality. These girls aren't ashamed, and I believe that's awesome! These girls have awesome tracks like "All the things she said" a nice cover of "How soon is now", and one of my favs "Malchik Gay". If you feel like putting yourself in a good mood, and feel like dancing, then I definetely recommend this CD! Get them now, it's well worth it!
__label__1 Not worth it - taped @ extended/super-long play & inaudible.: Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
__label__1 didn't see it yet but not buying it: It is not fair to call this a "review" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie, I refuse to buy it. I LOVE The Hobbit from my childhood. I have been searching for months for the movie in DVD for my kids and after reading several reviews, I know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular DVD. I just want the same movie I watched as a kid on a DVD. Is that too much to ask?
__label__1 Great cartoon, horrible quality: This cartoon was one of my favorites when I was a kid. So now that I've got kids of my own I bought a DVD copy to watch with them. Unfortunately, the DVD is the worst analog to digital transfer I've ever seen. It has a very flat appearance, the colors are lifeless, not vivid like the original. They should fire the guy who made this DVD version. It looks like a cheap bootleg, maybe even worse. Don't buy this DVD until they re-release it with a proper analog to digital transfer. Also, I think they edited parts out of the original cartoon. I rarely ever rate anything on Amazon, but this is so bad I felt like I had to warn other people. If you've still got a VHS player, the VHS version of the film looks great.
__label__1 over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance: seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read "the hobbit," i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, "bilbo gump." the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous.
__label__1 Missing sounds... how annoying: For the first time in my life, I wish I had a VHS copy even with the DVD released. I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie, and there is no vortex sound effect. Then the entire scene in Lake Town is... muted. The arrows are silenced, the dragon roars as a mouse, and the fire, it crackles as a loud annoyance. I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing, now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD. I will be buying the VHS shortly.
__label__1 The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie, including Smaug's fire, his whooshing noise over the village, the arrows plinking, wolves howling, etc. It is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version, and if I could I would ask for my money back.
__label__1 MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This "THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!
__label__2 Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by " Orson Bean") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon " Smaug". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with " Return of the King", " The Last Unicorn", and " Flight of Dragons".Also recommend: Lord of the Rings ( 1978), Return of the King,and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings.
__label__1 TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not, the DVD version's soundtrack is missing a very large number of key elements - the majority of the sound effects, ambient sound backgrounds, some of the music, and even the occaisional bit of dialogue. The result is like watching an unfinished movie with a "temp" audio track. A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie, which depends so much on sound. Do NOT buy the DVD - you're not really getting the movie as advertised.
__label__1 Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/
__label__2 A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful.
__label__1 Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy.
__label__1 Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn VHS tape onto a disk. The movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about. The theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack. There are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated. I have no idea how they messed that up! If i had purchased it locally, i would return it, but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it, hopefully on a blu-ray. My recommendation is Do Not Purchase this version unless you really cannot live without a copy, any copy.
__label__2 Now thats what I call a bible: Fantastic - it arrived yesterday, 4000 miles to England in under 5 days from ordering - well done Amazon! When I opened it I thought "here at last is the bible I've been looking for for years"!
__label__1 PRINT SIZE IS 6.2 NOT 9.5: I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
__label__2 Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!
__label__1 Caution before downloading: The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents, and no listing for the all important abbreviation needed for "this book." I appreciate that the download was free, now I know why. Discouraged.
__label__1 Tiny Font: I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
__label__2 Good, cheap Bible for travel: No footnotes or references, just your basic Bible. It's nice and small but still readable. Fits right in my purse. The only complaint I have is that I left it in my Jeep during the summer and the cover curled up pretty bad but not bad for the price.
__label__2 Great for Gifts!: Super handy and looks legit, even though it's TruTone! And because it's less than $10, it makes great gifts! I've bought quite a few just to give away to my fellow church-goers!
__label__1 Too long: The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
__label__2 Yamaha ipod dock: Easy to connect, GUI display is clear and easily readable from a distance, and the remote of my Yamaha RX-V2700 is responsive. You can select the option to charge as well. You have to enable video output to see the video on another monitor.The only thing it DOES NOT seem to do, is to go the next level up from music i.e. video, photos (via the remote). You can manually watch video/photos (if you have those features on your ipod) by physically using the click-wheel and then you can stop/start the video with the remote. That last shortcoming prevents it from attaining a "5".
__label__1 Still have not received it: I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September, my emails to mike@nextpower.com are bounced back to me, and I cannot find a way to contact Amazon regarding this item...so I guess I am just out the money sent.
__label__1 Could have been better.: I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
__label__1 This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right..: from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a "we have to value what we've got" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!
__label__2 Great Remote Mount Radio: This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have, yet it's less than $100. The full channel scanning and DualWatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good. If you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great. Once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great. A great radio for a great value!
__label__2 Inspired movie!: I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested, you can get this movie in DVD format from World Wide Pictures homepage (http://shop.wwp.org). I'm going to order one from there today.
__label__2 Can I give it 10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!
__label__1 Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend "Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled "The Sacred And The Profane", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message.
__label__1 you gotta know when to fold em Kenny: Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
__label__1 Short Summary: These guys look like a couple of crackheads (especially the one on the left). Sad how they are being paid for this garbage. I guess a Jr. High School diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the ATL. Enjoy being rich and ignorant.
__label__1 Breathtaking cinematography, invasive music, 1 hour too long: One of the most beautifully filmed movies in recent years. The beauty of the images is about all there is to recommend here. The manipulative music is far too loud and sappy. Ethan Hawke is a robot. Scott Hicks commentary is one of the most boring on any DVD. Far too long, the only thing keeping your finger from the fast forward button are the images themselves.
__label__1 Basically "To Kill A Mockingbird" With Different Ethnicity: Would have given it a 1-star, but the production values were gorgeous (cinematography, music score, sound, set decoration.) However, very hard to follow with numerous flashbacks in flashbacks (I think.) I didn't read the book so I didn't know the story, but the author seems to have channeled another famous book. All the actors seemed put out to have shown up without any intrest in fleshing out their chracters, no chemistry inter-play with any of the characters. Slowwwwwwww..........
__label__1 Impassioned Drudgery: This movie, though it tells a compelling story, it simply filled with drudgery. I have not read the book, and still may, but I also consider the story line to be absolutely full of a race-baiting mentality. I do not recommend "Snow Falling on Cedars."
__label__1 nibbling on kelp: Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet, dismal, cold and foggy weather of the region. Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale. No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with. That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born. The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were. The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy.
__label__2 Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie, I haven't read the book, but the storyline in the movie is excellent. I would buy this on blu-ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available. My only fault with the movie is that (in my opinion) the "overdubbed voice-overs" (not sure exactly what you call them) toward the end seem a little overbearing.
__label__1 A True Stinker: Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END
__label__1 Great Work Of Fiction: Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.
__label__2 Celica 2002 GTS, no body kit: This fits pretty well, and doesn't stick out off the back very much at all. It does slightly press upwards on my bumper, this could be from a previous accident so I don't want to dock more than one star. Install is a little bit of a pain because of the angle to get the original brackets off, but I did it on my own in a parking lot. I use it to be able to take bikes with me, and still have some space for people/other stuff. I used this bike rack:Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1.25 or 2-Inch Receiver)
__label__2 Siberian Chipmunks: Basic Informative book on keeping siberian chipmunks as pets. My used copy was in great condition.Chipmunks
__label__2 attention all TY collectors!!!!!: one of the best toys. low education, but a lot of fun! a best friend for hippity, floppity, and flippity!
__label__2 fantastic!: I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies...they're the best! Their songs are wonderful and they're sung beautifully.
__label__1 Unable to return miss labled Stearns Rearm Kit: We have five SoSpenders inflatable PFDs model number 38APRO and ordered five rearming kits#0944 which state on the package that they fit the SoSpenders 38APRO PFD. The water sensitive bobbin in the kits does not fit the PFD and when we attempted to return the kits in the original packages to Amazon they would not accept them saying that they can not accept shipping of items that have gas in them. It is strange that they can ship to us items that have gas in it but we can not ship the same product in the original unopened package back to them. Now we are stuck with $120.00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us. Our recomendation is DO NOT USE AMAZON as they are a company that does not admit it has a miss labled or improperly packaged product.
__label__2 Algebra: Structure and Method Book 1 (California Edition): No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact, it hardly looks used.
__label__1 I'm happy my order was canceled: After reading several reviews, I ordered these, but they never arrived and I was reimbursed the purchase price, so I went to a local sporting goods store and compared these to theNikon 10x42 Monarch. After comparing the two, even though the Monarch's were more money. The Monarch 10x42 is a lot better quality Binocular. And I have been very happy with them .
__label__2 GREAT MOVIE: I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings. I highly recommend the DVD version. The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant! Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better, I believe it is worth watching. I'd rent it before buying it.
__label__1 Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in "her voices."Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story, read Mark Twain's book.This movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived (aside from Jesus).
__label__1 Miscast: This movie was 100% perfect, except Faye Dunaway should have caked some make-up on and played Joan of Arc herself. She has limitless talents and would have brought the movie what is was missing--a truly spiritual heroine. I'm telling you, Faye Dunaway was born to play this part. One can only hope of a re-make, and soon!
__label__1 well.....it was okay: i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have "joan of arc" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you dont know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didnt want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. dont bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.
__label__2 Very historical: This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But, it does try to tie history in it. Joan of Ark is potrayed to be a nice warrior. Millia Jovovich is a great actor. This movie got me very interested in Joan of Ark. This is one of my favorite movies ever!
__label__1 The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes.
__label__1 Great music, Bad recording: This session was recorded in Ohio in 1980. I don't know what kind of recording equipment was used, but the sound is terrible!
__label__2 Fantastic Book: A wonderfully written book. A superb plot. Great characters. Interesting setting. A classic. A must read. One of my 10 favorite works of fiction. Maybe even better than Shogun!
__label__1 Never got the book and it's been a month...: I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
__label__2 My kids love to read this over and over: I have 3 boys, all of them love learning about bugs. It's perfect for my oldest (who doesn't like to be near bugs, but loves learning about them). It's also perfect for my middle and youngest boys, who pick up every and any bugs they can get their hands on. I am so happy we purchased this book (we did a few Christmases ago), and they still love reading it. There are a few every-day bugs in the book, and a lot of exotic and poisonous bugs, which seems to interest my kiddos even more. It's full of large, very detailed photos of each bug that's described. Awesome.
__label__1 not as good as i was hoping: when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not, i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system, which the radio i have in my tractor for work(cobra25) also has the soundtracker system and it works great, but when i recieved it and set it up with a 2ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional, radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on. this radio constantly freezes(when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch9 and you wont be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything, you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on) and the front firing speaker is very quiet. i should have went with another cobra25 and just bought an external speaker
__label__2 Mac cover: I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one, and he loves it now that he has it! Stylish and functional, what else could you want?
__label__2 Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering.
__label__2 The kids loved it!: Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day, and the kids will watch it despite having seen it lots of times before. The blu-ray quality is very good, and there is nothing in this film which will disturb young children - mine are 5 and 8 and they both enjoy it. Recommended!
__label__1 Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!: CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: "RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT SweetRoxanne@hotmail.com IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT HELPFUL, E-MAIL ME AT Roxanne12@aol.com
__label__2 Adoption message: This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate.
__label__2 A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!: This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!), big brother George, SnowBell, the impostor Mom & Dad Mouse Family, everybody is great, just I really can't stand Stuart that much!! GASP!! Maybe it is just that he is so naive. He jus thinks everybody loves him. Or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the Little's were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes SnowBell. I know, I know, that is the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY, but it bothers me a little. So I give 'Stuart Little' 4 Stars, and well, maybe 4 and a Half.
__label__1 suartlittle: they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
__label__1 not necessarily for kids: My two young children enjoyed watching this movie, but I was very disappointed when I heard the cats swearing. I don't want my children to pick up and mimic that language, thinking that it's cute and fun because it is from this movie. The mice and cats are very cute and well done, but the cursing didn't add anything to what should have been a family show. For cute animals, there are better movies to watch.
__label__1 Too bad no one read the book: This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse, not because it has anything to do with E.B White's book of the same name. I felt like I was watching a re-telling of "Annie" rather than seeing a film version of a great story. A typical result of creating a giant marketing and merchandising machine.
__label__2 A somewhat entertaining historical account: Given my odd sense of humor, I wasn't suprised that I liked this book. While tragic, the deaths accounted for remind us that when we're dealing with nature, we must deal with it on its own rules. The "pedestrians have the right-of-way" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck.
__label__1 George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them.
__label__1 Not very good: I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature, and perhaps this book is to blame. I think I've been spoiled by the Norton and Bevington anthologies I've used in other classes, because this was truly a let-down. If you're a prof looking for a good book to use for class, have your students spend the extra twenty-spot and get a Norton.
__label__2 good: I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great.
__label__1 dated...: 'Cheap and cheerful' is how I'd describe this book. Which means there are better, and more up to date, ideas around on how you can manage time and life. I found the ideas dated and the author's style prescriptive.Much better value, highly practical, and with some innovative ideas, is Mark Forster's Get Everything Done (And Still Have Time To Play).
__label__1 okay, but derivative: Lots of interesting examples but too many of them seem to come from a right-wing perspective. Also the book, which is humorless, reminds me of other better-done accounts of the same areas. The lessons of the book should be applied to the book itself. It doesn't fare well if this is done.
__label__1 Complete Waste of time / Film: The premise seemed alluring... saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future... But nothing makes much sense in this movie. all of The charactors can't think past their nose. What drives them on? oh yeah their unknown B actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic Sci-Fi... Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks, but I had to this time cause this one pissed me off so. I've seen many B-movie Sci-fi's but this one takes the cake. Of all the movies waiting to be transfered to DVD what Exec. Booted this one into production? Must be another groopie friend of Peter Fonda. I thought with Fonda's name attached to it, it couldn't be half bad. But was I wrong!
__label__2 Everything is better with Jello!: Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez, Skinny Puppy, Antipop Consortium, Jeru Da Damaja, KRS-ONE etc. Everybody just wants to dance and be......entertained as the world around them falls apart.Anyhow, rants aside this is a very this album, it has a very Motown kind of sound to it though I'm sure that is just synths and not actual instruments.Regardless the M.C. is good, the words hard hittting, and like I say, Jello Biafra from the Dead Kennedys is on it, you can't go wrong!
__label__1 Bad Book!!!: This book was bad..... in organization, setup, explanation, and examples.... If you want a good java book, LEWIS and LOFTUS is great. I regretfully have to buy BIG JAVA another Horstman great for a class. I sure hope its better than this one!
__label__2 Remember children, it's only the concepts.: Calm down, calm down. The title of this book has neither '..in a week', nor '..in 24 hours and certainly not '..while you drive to work' in its title.It teaches you the 'concepts' and 'essentials' of Java programming. It doesn't cover IO in detail nor threads, nor games programming. When you've finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by Reilly's animal series. The main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account. I can recommed this book to absolute beginners or those not familiar with object orientated programming.Bonus points go to the first half of the book. Minus points go to coverage of IO.
__label__1 barely useful: Flimsy construction, indoor display is hard to read at most angles, and the remote unit only has a temperature sensor--no hygrometer, which wasn't clear from the product description.
__label__1 Could have been better: I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads, good subject matter, not well executed or explained at all. Please rewrite the book, Ms. Abraham and I will buy it again.
__label__2 Great product. UI could be improved: I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However, I always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old.
__label__2 Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR 102 is a terrific radio, especially considering the price here on Amazon. It is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid-Mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and fearsome thunderstorms. I will certainly feel safer with this one close by.My only complaint: the instruction sheet is printed in a typeface so small I had to enlarge it on a copy machine in order to read it. While the instructions are clear, the layout is sensible, and the programming relatively simple, trying to decipher 4-point type made the whole experience needlessly frustrating. C'mon, guys! Your radio is a really good one! Why diminish a fine product with nearly invisible -- and thereby unreadable -- instructions!?
__label__1 Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries, I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment. Additionally, I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced. I returned this item.
__label__1 Sealy Best Fit 330-Thread Count Cotton Sateen Sheet Set: Purchased this set of sheets on April 16, 2011, only two months ago. The fitted sheet have started piling, which indicates not a good quality set of sheets. The only thing that I loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress. For the price of these sheets the quality is just not there. The sheets that these replace were 5 years old and just started ripping, two months is unacceptable.Sincerely,Jody M Becnel
__label__1 OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them.
__label__1 Like the idea behind the phone but not this one: this is my second cordless phone with a headset-this one I can not hear out of. I contacted the seller Rainbow Barter and they said all sales were final. So I tried to contact IBM sat on the phone 25 minutes the first time on hold, was disconnected and I am sitting again 25 minutes. maybe this time I will get luck :(
__label__1 Broken Bottle: Ordered this set for my grandma, it showed up 3 days before christmas and the main perfume bottle was cracked and had leaked every where.Wouldnt recommend buying from the seller, should have just went to jcpenny in the first place.
__label__1 Chiefs: I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
__label__1 Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating: 1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, "Simplify Expectations" and "Simplify Relationships" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to "just relax". Overall, a disappointing read.
__label__1 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time.
__label__2 A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his "magic." Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off.
__label__1 I didn't really like the book it was boring, the end=best.: It was grat at some parts and boring at others. The end made up for alot of the book.
__label__1 very different book: i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.

__label__2 A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes: Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan, 1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent.
__label__1 What a disappointment.: My son's two favorite things in the world: 1. Little Einsteins, 2. Space. He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD. We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release. And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents. As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space. I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight. At least that one actually talked about the planets. I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying. :(
__label__1 Need something to light a fire? Here you go...: I gave this one star, because negative stars are not allowed. The previous review has to have been written by someone closely related to the book.I was a teen-ager during the '80s Ninja Craze and even then, this book would have been seen as a complete joke. I think I was expecting a Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon to turn up somewhere in the book, but was disappointed to not see one.Bottom-line - Stay away from this book. If you are really interested in something about ninja, look into Stephen K. Hayes.
__label__2 A+: item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!
__label__2 As expected: I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected, easy as pie. Comics are still a great gift.
__label__2 This guy was evil: This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer, but Bob was way worse than what this book says. Check out another book about Bob Hope called "Thanks For The Memories" by Brice Taylor. Yep, Bob and Michael Jackson had something in common, only Bob had underaged girls not boys.
__label__2 good for the tackle box: I got this as a gift for my 10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing. He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.
__label__1 thank you: This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
__label__1 One Star, and it goes to JLH and the Stiller's: The characters with the smallest amount of screen time, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ben Stiller and his real life dad, Jerry Stiller, are the only ones worth watching for in this sad little effort. The story is a mishmash and not at all interesting, but hey, Ms Hewitt does look great, so if you're into that I can recommend it. One thing I do want to point out, however, is that there is no commentary track on the DVD, contrary to what the specs show.
__label__1 Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD, because you'll be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions.
__label__1 Worst book from Whitman ever: The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone, the book is printed in CHINA...Whitman has sunk to a new low on this one.Buy any other book other than this one if you really want to use it.The poorest book that Whitman has ever offered, lets hope it's not theirstandard for the future.
__label__2 My nephew loved this!: I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
__label__2 This is a Great Product!: I bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for! But I was actually blown away by it, the picture quality is wonderful, the sound is good unless it's noisy, though what I did was used some mini speakers you can buy for discmans they work great to add extra volume. The battery does last about three hours but it does come with an a/c adapter and car adapter which is nice. I also liked the fact that it came with a cord(don't know what it's called) but I was able to plug it into my home theater system for surround sound and also into my tv for larger picture. I also rent a lot of dvd's and all of the rentals worked fine for me, if your having trouble with a disc just clean it, I use soap and water although I hear that's a big no no but it's works great! Overall it is a awesome system for the money!
__label__1 it stings: picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
__label__1 Terrible Nickel Allergy triggered by strap connectors/adjusters: The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
__label__1 Product is cheaply made, Customer Service was terrible from Elmosworld: I purchased 2 of these items, on one of them, the LCD display does not work perfectly (the 0 as a part of 12:00 pm is missing a line of the 0 on the display- see my submitted pictures) but this is no big deal- the item still works OK.The other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and UPS damaged it during shipping.It took me filing a complaint with Amazon just to get a response from this company, and the situation is still not resolved, they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them.I will never order from Elmosworld again. Terrible customer service.
__label__1 Genuine Chinese Crap: This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse, but you can't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is a true piece of crap. Do not purchase it.I bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale. Boy am I glad I didn't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is cheaply constructed all the way around. Everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap. Want poor reception? You got it! Want brittle plastic that breaks easily? You got it! Want a compass that doesn't work? You got that too!Be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning. If it says "Made in China" avoid it if you can. If China does make anything worth owning they certainly don't export it to the USA."Oregon Scientific" is another term for cheap piece of Chinese crap.You will regret it if you buy this radio.Caveat emptor.
__label__2 I agree: I agree with the review from August 8, 2000 in that Mary Anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else. However, I did really enjoy the book. I thought When Mary Anne helped Sunny it showed more of her personality from the old series, and I liked that Mary Anne more. I thought it was funny how active Sunny was.
__label__1 LOUSY PHONE: Good Price with a nice package, but very poor quality sound. We purchased 2 of these phones...both had echo, and low sound quality. We could not even have a conversation with the other party. Both are being returned!!
__label__2 Great CD: This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album "So" in 1986. Go through the track list, and you will likely find more than a few you've heard on the radio. A glaring ommission is Gabriels' most famous (and possibly best) song "In Your Eyes". Although you will find that at least a quarter of the sixteen tracks on this CD come from "So", that song is missing from this collection. For that reason, I knock a point off this "best of" collection.
__label__2 Just what I wanted: I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away, the size was good, wore them every day and they were always comfortable, no blisters forming. Very happy with them, and would purchase other Propet products.
__label__1 poor quality: Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
__label__1 Poor light - Looses charge fast: I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
__label__1 Flashlight: Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
__label__1 Reed switch doesn't work, the flashlight is inoperable.: I am helping my son with an electromagnetic induction science fair project and have studied extensively the requirements for these types of flashlights to operate. This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, "you get what you pay for", is proven true, once again.
__label__1 Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...: I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me, there were only two other people in the theater. They stood up and left halfway through. There was a good reason for this. This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking. Good for nostalgia value only.
__label__1 Not Recommended: I am very disappointed with this phone. I have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone, and then when I do get a dial tone and make a call, I have a very hard time hearing the person on the other end of the line. The caller id feature does not work, and I know it isn't my phone company because our other CID displays work fine. It always just flashes "Ringing" on the display when the phone rings. I have owned this phone for 6 months now, and I am planning to replace it very soon.
__label__2 Better than expected: I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is, I rarely buy them unless they're part of a series like this one. So, I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book.
__label__1 Let's replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference...: This movie is just plain bad.Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie, which also sucked, I was hoping for some needed zombie respite. Not happening here.What dialogue and acting there is seems forced and badly delivered. Frankly most lines and acting seemed like they belonged in a bad porno rather than a good zombie movie (neither of which is this movie).It seems like whenever there was a lack of dialogue for a scene, it was simply replaced with profanity of all sorts.I ended up turning this movie off half way through it, which I very rarely do. I felt the movie bored me, offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money.If you want a "good" zombie movie, I don't think this is it. SeeDawn of the Dead,Zombieland,Fido,Shaun of the Dead,Resident Evil,Dead Snow. Pretty much anything other than this movie.
__label__1 Original thought: This movie had an original idea, but lact so much for being a zombie movie. At times it was just stupid! Another zombie movie id pass on. Doubt I'll be re-watching this movie any time soon!
__label__1 Low Quality Packing tape: I pack and ship items on a daily basis. I bought this tape to seal my packages. It was cheap (so yay for price), but extremely low quality. It will not adequately seal a cardboard mailer without many layers. Even then, I worry that the package will open in transit.Lesson learned. Next time I will pay more for a higher quality product.
__label__1 Bad!!I false advertiser!: I have to give them a negative-10! the add clearly says a 6pack so I ordered 5 sixpacs and the only sent me 5 rolls! Clearly false advertising! I even orderd some for my sister! What a rip off! Don't order from them!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus the shipping of $8 that is a RIP OFF!!!!!Scotch Sealing Tape, 1.88 x 54.6 Yards, Clear, 6 Pack (3690)
__label__1 sent wrong speaker: Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation. A real letdown from amazon. They should change the picture.
__label__2 there's nothing better than live rolling stones: i own three rolling stones albums now, but there's nothing like listening to them live on cd. there are two new studio tracks on the cd. at first, i thought they had covered "sex drive" by twisted sister and w.a.s.p., but a closer listen brung up different lyrics.
__label__2 Stones live with a full band: Many people prefer the Stones as just the 5 playing live, but I also like when they brought on this large troupe along for the shows, more backup singes, brass section and 2 keyboards. The Stones are much more controlled and played very well and together. What you dont get is the raw energy of a rock concert as you would find on their 1981 "Still Life" album, but I find this album most enjoyable. My only gripe is they left off "Gimme Shelter" which they did an incredible job at and threw in 2 lousy studio redcordings to get a hit single out of for bigger sales."High Wire" is a good song, the 2nd studio song "Sex Drive" is a joke and should have stayed in the vaults, complete waste to add that trash song to this magnificient live Stones album.You can get the accompanying DVD "Live at the Max" and se it for yourself.
__label__2 Awsome.: I dont know what the lower guys issues with his connection are, I have 0 issues with ping, mine is always in the 130 range. Maybe you should stop DLing porn while playing multiplayer games.This is a great game, very fast paced and enjoyable. You can choose to enter any type of vehicle, while being more arcade than simulation, the action and craziness are well worth the low price offered by EA games...
__label__2 G'Day! G'Day!: Great selection of songs, Mate. Disapointed that "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" was only instrumental. Other wise very happy.
__label__2 Great: Really good ! All the classic Aussie songs, including Waltzing Matilda,Botany Bay and Tie Me Kangroo Down...you don't want to miss this one.
__label__1 bling bling: man, this album is phat. the title track, "F the BS", and "Buttermilk Bisquick", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the 12" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla
__label__2 Excellent service!!!: I received my shipment of this Blu-ray disc in excellent condition and in record delivery time. Thanks!
__label__2 Review by a music lover: If you love rock and roll music and you appreciate it's history, you will love this movie. Great sound, great music, great performances and solid acting. This movie confirms in my mind who the ultimate father of rock and roll really is and how the Rolling Stones came up with the name for their band. Very interesting.
__label__2 Changing from a 20th Century status and power driven environment to a 21st continuous learning and collaborative environment: After Image is much more than a marketing and branding education. Grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the 21st Century. His explaination of moving from a work/status ethic to a continuous learning/collaborative/networking ethic provides a structure for individuals, organizations and countries to base their readiness for the real work of the 21st Century.
__label__2 Oh, yeah! The "Coriolanus effect"!: This one isn't really "science fiction," since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance.
__label__1 Lousy 802.11 reception & transmission.: I'm using this on a Win98SE PC to connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. It sees the base station fine, but when the Belkin is touching the base station it transmits at 70% signal strength. My PowerBook can see the base station at 100% one floor up, 80% on the second floor up.Belkin software was easy to use and configure. Maybe my HP Pavilion causes a lot of RF interference? Unknown, but I'd try a Linksys or Hawking over the Blekin. Don't be swayed by the price.
__label__1 Does not work with XP: After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box, to use with its sister product (Belkin F5D6130 AP), I GAVE UP. Included CD was flakey -- so, got new driver from Belkin website. Installed & worked -- until I rebooted, then XP froze up. Had to disable an XP service (SSDP Discovery). After reboot, USB device is recognized, but offline, and cannot bring online. I have extensive experience with networking (20 years). Tech support was of no help. Could be an XP problem, but note: Belkin Driver is "unsigned". Avoid this product (for XP) until Belkin releases a better XP driver. Going forward, I will be looking for a wireless Ethernet bridge, possibly LinkSys WET11.
